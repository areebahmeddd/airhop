//! The C ABI, consumed by `ios/Airhop/AirhopTorManager.swift`.
//!
//! A small set of functions and no structs. There are no callbacks or
//! allocations that cross the FFI boundary, so no corresponding free function
//! is required. Swift polls `airhop_tor_status`, which acquires a lock and
//! packs the status, while the manager handles all other decisions.
//!
//! The header is generated from this file by cbindgen (`cbindgen.toml`) rather
//! than hand-written, so the two cannot drift.
//!
//! Every entry point runs inside `crate::catch_panic`: unwinding into a Swift
//! frame is undefined behavior.

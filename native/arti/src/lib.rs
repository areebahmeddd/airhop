//! Airhop's embedded Tor client.
//!
//! One Rust crate, two FFI faces. iOS links it as a static library and calls the
//! C ABI in `ffi_c`; Android loads it as a shared object and calls the JNI surface
//! in `ffi_jni`. Everything above those two files is identical on both
//! platforms, so "Tor is on" means the same thing on an iPhone and on a Pixel,
//! and there is one place to fix when it does not.
//!
//! What the app gets is a SOCKS5 listener on loopback and nothing else. No
//! control port, no torrc, no configuration surface. The app points its sockets
//! at the port and reads a status snapshot to draw a banner.
//!
//! Three properties are load-bearing, and each is a decision, not an
//! accident.
//!
//! **It cannot leak.** `arti_client` has no clearnet path. Every byte that
//! enters the listener leaves through a circuit or does not leave at all. So
//! failing closed is a property of the design rather than of timing: there is no
//! window, however short, in which a request takes a direct route because the
//! circuit was not up yet.
//!
//! **The listener binds before bootstrap.** `start` returns only once the port
//! is accepting, so a caller that gets `AIRHOP_TOR_OK` may dial immediately. A dial made
//! during bootstrap waits for a circuit; a dial made after a bootstrap that
//! never completed fails. Binding after bootstrap instead would leave the app
//! unable to tell "starting" from "broken" for the whole bootstrap, and leave
//! callers probing the port to find out.
//!
//! **Progress is real.** `TorClient::bootstrap_events()` is the client's own
//! view of how far along it is and why it is stuck. Nothing here infers state
//! from log text.
//!
//! Panics never cross the FFI boundary. Every entry point goes through
//! [`catch_panic`], which returns an error code instead of aborting: Tor is the
//! app's optional internet half, and a bug in it must not take the mesh down.

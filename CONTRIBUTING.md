# Contributing & Development Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Airhop. This guide covers coding standards, crypto rules, testing requirements, and the pull request process.

By participating, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

> Standards for everyone working in this codebase, for human contributors and AI agents alike. If it isn't in the code and isn't here, it doesn't exist as a standard.

## 1. Read Before You Touch Anything

Every contributor reads these documents before writing a single line of code, in this order:

1. [`docs/design/VISION.md`](docs/design/VISION.md): what Airhop is and what it will never compromise on
2. [`docs/spec/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/spec/ARCHITECTURE.md): the architecture decisions and why they were made
3. [`docs/spec/PROTOCOLS.md`](docs/spec/PROTOCOLS.md): the wire format and exact constants you must not break
4. [`docs/dev/PROGRESS.md`](docs/dev/PROGRESS.md): current build state; what's done and what's next

Skipping this step causes rework.

## 2. Build Order

```
src/core/ -> Native modules -> src/features/ -> src/ui/
```

- **Do not write `src/features/` code** until the `src/core/` service it depends on has passing unit tests.
- **Do not write `src/ui/` code** until the feature logic in `src/features/` is proved functional.
- **Native code** (`android/`, `ios/`, `native/arti/`, `native/iptproxy/`) is a thin I/O layer. It changes when a radio or the OS demands it (a transport's connection handling, a platform quirk, a Tor bump), never to carry protocol logic, which lives in TypeScript.

## 3. Coding Standards

### TypeScript (all code)

- Strict mode everywhere. All files must pass `tsc --strict` with zero errors.
- No `any` types in `src/core/` or `src/bridge/`. Period.
- Named exports only. No default exports in `src/core/` or `src/bridge/`.
- File naming: `kebab-case.ts` throughout.
- One concern per `src/core/` module, each independently testable. A file that needs "and" to describe it is two files. `src/services/mesh-service.ts` and several `src/features/` screens are far past that; they are known refactor targets, not precedent.

### Native Code (Android + iOS)

- Platform code lives in `android/` and `ios/`. The other native trees are `native/arti/`, the embedded Tor client both platforms compile from one Rust crate, and `native/iptproxy/`, the pluggable transports it dials to reach a bridge.
- Native modules expose **raw bytes** to TypeScript. They do not interpret packets, run routing logic, or make crypto decisions. `native/arti/` is the exception that proves it: it owns a SOCKS5 listener and its own lifecycle, and still knows nothing about packets, routing or encryption.
- `AirhopBLEModule` is the one and only native module for BLE. Do not create additional BLE modules.
- Rust is formatted with `cargo fmt` and linted with `cargo clippy -D warnings`. CI runs both.

## 4. Crypto Rules

These are not style guidelines. Violating them is a build blocker.

| Rule                                                                                       | Enforcement                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| All crypto MUST use `@noble/curves`, `@noble/ciphers`, `@noble/hashes`                     | Reject any PR importing other crypto libs   |
| NEVER use `Math.random()` for anything security-related                                    | `@noble/hashes` HKDF or OS CSPRNG only      |
| Polyfill `crypto.getRandomValues` with `react-native-get-random-values` at app entry point | Required before importing any noble library |
| Private keys MUST only be stored via `src/core/crypto/keychain.ts`                         | Registry the panic wipe enumerates          |
| Message content MUST only be stored in encrypted MMKV                                      | Not AsyncStorage, not SQLite plaintext      |
| NEVER log private keys, session keys, plaintext message content, or Cashu token proofs     | Zero exceptions                             |
| All outgoing packets MUST be Ed25519 signed                                                | `packet-codec.ts` enforces this             |
| All incoming packets MUST have signatures verified before relay or display                 | Drop on failure, never propagate            |

## 5. Protocol Compatibility Rules

These rules exist because a bug here breaks Airhop's interoperability with bitchat.

- **Never change the bitchat v2 packet byte layout** in `packet-codec.ts` without:
  1. Bumping `version` byte from `2` to `3`
  2. Maintaining a `v2` decode path for backward compat
  3. Testing cross-protocol delivery: Airhop v3 node -> bitchat node
- **Never change the BLE Service UUID or Characteristic UUID.** They are fixed in `PROTOCOLS.md`, section 1. Changing them creates a network partition.
- **Never change Peer ID derivation.** It is `hex(SHA-256(noiseStaticPubKey)).slice(0, 16)`. Changing it breaks gossip sync and DM addressing.
- **Airhop-only packet types start at `0x50`**: `0x50` (private channel, sealed) and `0x51` (private channel message). Both are safe to broadcast: bitchat drops unknown types silently. Anything new must sit at `0x50` or above. Do not take anything in bitchat's range: `0x2A` and `0x2B` are reserved upstream for courier spray-ack, and `0x29` is push-to-talk, which bitchat ships too and which must stay wire-identical.
- Before any protocol change ships, run: Airhop node ↔ bitchat-ios node ↔ bitchat-android node message exchange test.

## 6. Testing Requirements

### src/core/ (100% coverage required on critical paths)

| Module                        | Required Tests                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packet-codec.ts`             | Encode/decode round-trip; byte layout matches `PROTOCOLS.md`, section 2                                               |
| `noise-xx.ts`                 | Pass official Noise test vectors from [noiseprotocol.org](https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html#appendix-test-vectors) |
| `noise-xx.ts`                 | Cross-language test: JS client handshake with bitchat-ios Swift server                                                |
| `gossip-sync.ts` (GCS filter) | Bit-for-bit match with bitchat Swift/Kotlin test vectors                                                              |
| `deduplicator.ts`             | LRU eviction at 1000 entries; 5-minute expiry window                                                                  |
| `flood-router.ts`             | TTL decrement; jitter scheduling; loop prevention                                                                     |
| `cashu.ts`                    | Token parse/embed/redeem round-trip                                                                                   |

Run tests: `npm test -- --testPathPattern=src/core`

### Native

The pure parts of the native modules have unit tests on both platforms: the stream framing every TCP link uses (`Framing`) and the Wi-Fi Aware dial rules (`AwareDial`, which differ by platform on purpose). Anything that touches a radio is covered by the simulator and by devices, not here. Keep new logic of that kind in a pure object beside its module so it can be tested the same way; each platform's README says how.

```sh
cd android && ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest   # android/app/src/test/
swift test --package-path ios                    # ios/Tests/, any Mac
```

## 7. AI Agent Usage

Three specialized agents are available in `.github/agents/`. Invoke them via VS Code Copilot chat.

### `@architect`

**When:** Before merging any change to `src/core/`, `android/`, or `ios/`.  
**What it checks:** Build order compliance, layer boundary violations, protocol compatibility, crypto library usage, key storage rules.

### `@upstream-sync`

**When:** When bitchat (`permissionlesstech/bitchat` or `permissionlesstech/bitchat-android`) publishes a new release or merge.  
**What it produces:** Integration checklist categorizing changes as PROTOCOL / SECURITY / BUG FIX / FEATURE, with mapping to Airhop's TypeScript equivalents.

### `@security-review`

**When:** Before any PR touching `src/core/crypto/`, key storage, or packet signing code.  
**What it checks:** Crypto compliance, key storage, packet signing, OWASP Mobile Top 10.

## 8. Commit Sign-Off (DCO)

All commits must include a `Signed-off-by` trailer. Use `git commit -s` to add it automatically:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```

This certifies that you agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/): that you wrote the contribution or have the right to submit it under this project's license.

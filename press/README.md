# Press

Store screenshots, the feature graphic and icon, social banners, and the listing copy. Output is in [out/](out/).

```bash
node press/build.mjs                # everything, light and dark
node press/build.mjs --light        # light only
node press/build.mjs --only=social  # one group: screens | social | icon
```

Each image is an HTML page screenshot by headless Chrome at 2x. Pages stay in `press/.build/` and can be opened in a browser.

## Panels

| #   | Screen                | Headline                          |
| --- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 01  | Mesh, radar           | Works when the network doesn't    |
| 02  | Direct message thread | Nobody in the middle can read it  |
| 03  | Chats, channels       | A room for wherever you are       |
| 04  | You                   | No sign up. No phone number.      |
| 05  | Wallet                | Send money with no signal         |
| 06  | Globe                 | Bluetooth ends. The mesh doesn't. |

Plus `00-brand`, a centred title card for social and press. The stores get the six panels.

Panel 06 has no device. Each dot on the globe is a Nostr relay location from `landing/src/data/relays.ts`, and the arcs are a minimum spanning tree over great-circle distance. Re-run [tools/generate-world.mjs](tools/generate-world.mjs) when that list changes.

Copy lives in [lib/copy.mjs](lib/copy.mjs).

45 files. Apple takes the 6.9in size and scales it down to smaller iPhones, so one iOS set covers every device. Play accepts 320px to 3840px on the long edge at a ratio no wider than 2:1.

Ship one theme. Light is the default; dark is there if you want it.

`supportsTablet` is `false` in `app.json`, so no iPad sizes are produced. Turn it on and add a 2064x2752 target to `PHONE_TARGETS` in [build.mjs](build.mjs).

The store sets are also committed under `fastlane/`, where Zapstore reads the Android one and `fastlane ios metadata` uploads the iOS one. Refresh both after a rebuild:

```bash
node press/build.mjs --fastlane=./fastlane
```

That writes `metadata/android/en-US/images/` and `screenshots/en-US/`, light theme, numbered from 1 in panel order.

## Notes

**The screens are redrawn in HTML, not captured from a device.** The captures were ~450px wide against the 1290 the App Store wants. If a screen changes materially in the app, change it here too.

**The wallet panel names `mint.minibits.cash`.** Swap it in [lib/screens.mjs](lib/screens.mjs) for whichever mint you want shown.

**Brand rules** are at [airhop.1mindlabs.org/brand](https://airhop.1mindlabs.org/brand). Source in `landing/src/pages/BrandPage.tsx`, downloads in `landing/public/brand/`.

```text
Airhop is a messenger for the moment the network stops.

Phones near you find each other over Bluetooth and form a mesh. Your message hops through them, up to seven phones deep, and reaches someone you have no signal to. No towers. No router. No bill. Nothing to sign up for.

WORKS WITH NO INTERNET
Bluetooth mesh is the default path, not a fallback. Everything below works with the network completely down.

NO ACCOUNT, EVER
Your identity is a key pair made on this phone and stored in the device keychain. No phone number, no email, no ID. Nothing registers anywhere, so there is nothing to seize and nothing to leak.

ENCRYPTED END TO END
Direct messages use the Noise XX handshake with Double Ratchet forward secrecy. The phones relaying your message cannot read it, and an old message stays protected even if a key leaks later.

ROOMS FOR WHERE YOU ARE
Public channels scoped to your block, your neighbourhood, your city or your region. When there is internet, they bridge over Nostr relays so a city channel still works when you are the only person on your street with the app. You can also read a place you are not in.

PIN A NOTICE THAT OUTLIVES THE CHAT
The bulletin board holds signed notices on your mesh or your area for one to seven days, with an urgent flag. Someone who walks past an hour later still gets it.

SEND MONEY WITH NO SIGNAL
Cashu ecash moves device to device over Bluetooth with no connection on either phone. Top up and cash out over Lightning when you are back online. Optional.

MORE
Live push-to-talk voice over the mesh. Photos, video, files and voice notes. Store-and-forward, so a nearby phone carries a sealed message until the recipient is reachable. Tor routing for internet traffic. QR contact exchange. Panic wipe: triple-tap and every key and message is gone in under a second. Compatible with bitchat on iOS and Android, on the same mesh, with no setup.

Open source under the MIT licence. No servers, no analytics, no tracking.

Airhop is a work in progress and has not had an external security audit. Do not rely on it for life-safety or high-risk use.
```

The audit sentence stays in. A reviewer who finds a claim overstated costs more than a cautious line.

## Upload checklist

App Store Connect

- [ ] Screenshots, name, subtitle, keywords and description are pushed by the release workflow from `fastlane/`. Promotional text is set by hand
- [ ] App Privacy: no data collected, no tracking, everything "not collected"
- [ ] Export compliance: non-exempt encryption, open source implementation, so the standard exemption applies. Have the repo link ready
- [ ] Review notes: BLE mesh needs two physical devices. A reviewer on one device sees an empty Mesh tab

Play Console

- [ ] `out/screenshots/android/light/*` into Phone screenshots
- [ ] `out/graphics/feature-graphic/light/feature-graphic.png`
- [ ] `out/graphics/icon-512.png`
- [ ] Title, short description, full description
- [ ] Data safety: no data collected, no data shared, encrypted in transit
- [ ] Declare nearby-devices and location, and why. Android requires location for BLE scanning; it is not used to locate anyone

Zapstore

- [ ] Reads `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US` from the repository, nothing to upload
- [ ] Zapstore publishes from a tagged release, so the listing follows it

Social

- [ ] `out/social/light/github-social-1280x640.png` into repo Settings, Social preview
- [ ] Profile headers on X and LinkedIn from `out/social/light/`
- [ ] Point press at [/brand](https://airhop.1mindlabs.org/brand)

The site's Open Graph image sits at `landing/public/og-preview.png`, where `landing/index.html` already points. Re-copy it after a rebuild that changes the card:

```bash
cp press/out/social/light/og-1200x630.png landing/public/og-preview.png
cp press/out/social/light/og-1200x630.png landing/public/brand/airhop-og.png
cp press/out/graphics/icon-512.png landing/public/brand/airhop-mark-512.png
```

# Airhop: Copilot Workspace Instructions

> This file is automatically loaded by VS Code GitHub Copilot for all sessions in this workspace. It provides the project context needed to give accurate, on-spec suggestions.

## What This Project Is

**Airhop** is a React Native (Expo SDK 57, RN 0.86+, bare workflow, New Architecture) cross-platform iOS + Android application for **offline-first, private peer-to-peer communication** over Bluetooth mesh networks, with Nostr internet bridging and Cashu ecash payments.

It is **wire-protocol-compatible with bitchat** (`permissionlesstech/bitchat`, `permissionlesstech/bitchat-android`), both under the Unlicense (public domain). Airhop nodes and bitchat nodes communicate over BLE without configuration.

Both bitchat implementations are used as a reference checkout. They are **not part of this repository**: clone them into `bitchat/` yourself, which is where every path below expects them.

- `bitchat/ios/`: Swift iOS implementation (copy freely)
- `bitchat/android/`: Kotlin Android implementation (copy freely)
- `bitchat/georelays/`: relay discovery scripts and relay CSV

Nothing under `bitchat/` is committed, so never cite one of those paths in a file that ships with the repo. Read them freely; write the conclusion, not the citation.

## Read These Docs First

Before working on any code, read in this order:

1. [`docs/design/VISION.md`](docs/design/VISION.md): why + principles
2. [`docs/spec/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/spec/ARCHITECTURE.md): architecture, stack decisions, code snippets
3. [`docs/spec/PROTOCOLS.md`](docs/spec/PROTOCOLS.md): wire format and constants you must not break
4. [`docs/dev/PROGRESS.md`](docs/dev/PROGRESS.md): current build state

## Non-Negotiable Rules

Apply these to every suggestion, every file, every PR:

1. **All crypto = `@noble/*` only.** `@noble/curves` (X25519, Ed25519), `@noble/ciphers` (ChaCha20-Poly1305, XChaCha20), `@noble/hashes` (SHA-256, HMAC, HKDF). No other crypto library. No exceptions.

2. **Polyfill at entry point.** `import 'react-native-get-random-values'` must be the first import in `src/app/app.tsx` before any `@noble` import.

3. **Key storage.** Private keys via `src/core/crypto/keychain.ts` only (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore); never `expo-secure-store` directly, or the panic wipe cannot reach them. MMKV for non-secret state.

4. **Packet signing.** Every outgoing packet is Ed25519-signed. Every incoming packet has its signature verified before relay or display. Drop unsigned/invalid packets silently.

5. **No plaintext on disk.** Message content is encrypted at rest. Panic wipe destroys all keys, every database, the media cache and Tor state, and reports whether the keys actually went.

6. **Protocol compatibility.** Never change the bitchat v2 packet byte layout (`src/core/mesh/wire/packet-codec.ts`) or the BLE Service UUID without a version bump and compat test. See `docs/spec/PROTOCOLS.md`.

7. **Native code boundary.** Swift lives in `ios/`. Kotlin lives in `android/`. These expose **raw bytes** to TypeScript. Protocol logic, routing, and crypto decisions live in TypeScript (`src/core/`).

8. **Build order.** `src/core/` -> native modules -> `src/features/` -> `src/ui/`. Never write UI before core is unit-tested.

9. **Never hardcode user-facing text.** Add a key to `src/i18n/locales/en.ts` and use `T("your.key")` (component) or `t("your.key")` (outside React). The catalog keeps copy reviewable in one diff and is what makes a thirtieth language a new file rather than a sweep of every screen. CI fails on any hardcoded string. See [`i18n.md`](.github/skills/i18n.md).

10. **Never translate anything that crosses the wire.** The `username.ts` adjective/noun lists derive identity. The transmitted `/hug` and `/slap` text is matched as an **English substring** by bitchat on receipt. Slash command tokens, channel names (`#bluetooth`) and geohashes are protocol. Translate the hint that describes a command, never the command. Enforced by `src/i18n/__tests__/catalog.test.ts`.

11. **Never translate at module load.** `const X = { label: t("k") }` type-checks, renders fine, and freezes in whichever language the app started in. Module constants hold `TranslationKey`s; the component translates on render. Enforced by `npm run i18n:audit`.

12. **Layout uses logical properties.** `marginStart` / `marginEnd` / `start` / `end`, never `marginLeft` / `left`. `textAlign: "right"` becomes `textAlignEnd` from `src/i18n/layout.ts`; directional chevrons come from there too. Arabic, Persian and Urdu ship, so a physical side is wrong on screen today rather than latent. Eslint rejects every one of them.

## Key Protocol Constants (Never Change Without Version Bump)

- **BLE Service UUID:** `F47B5E2D-4A9E-4C5A-9B3F-8E1D2C3A4B5C`
- **BLE Characteristic UUID:** `A1B2C3D4-E5F6-4A5B-8C9D-0E1F2A3B4C5D`
- **Noise algorithm:** `Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256`
- **TTL default:** 7 hops
- **Fragment frame budget:** 512 bytes encoded, giving 467 data bytes
- **Peer ID:** `hex(SHA-256(noiseStaticPubKey)).slice(0, 16)`

## TypeScript Conventions

- `tsc --strict` must pass with zero errors
- No `any` in `src/core/` or `src/bridge/`
- Named exports only in `src/core/` and `src/bridge/`
- File naming: `kebab-case.ts`
- One concern per `src/core/` module, each independently testable. A file that needs "and" to describe it is two files. `src/services/mesh-service.ts` and several `src/features/` screens are far past that; they are known refactor targets, not precedent.
- User-facing strings live in `src/i18n/locales/en.ts`, never inline in a component

## Code Style

- Write code and comments in a clear, concise, and factual style that follows standard language and platform conventions.
- Comment intent, assumptions, constraints, or non-obvious decisions, not the implementation.
- Prefer clear names over unnecessary comments.
- Do not use em dashes (`—`) or double hyphens (`--`) in comments or documentation. Avoid AI-style, robotic wording. Keep the language natural and human.
- Byte sizes follow IEC 80000-13: `KiB` / `MiB` for 1024-based values, which is every size this project controls, `KB` / `MB` only for genuinely decimal figures. The label must match the arithmetic.

## Agents Available

- **`@architect`**: architectural compliance review (build order, layer boundaries, protocol compat)
- **`@upstream-sync`**: analyze bitchat upstream changes and generate integration checklist
- **`@security-review`**: crypto, key storage, packet signing, OWASP Mobile Top 10 audit

# Nostr Gift-Wrap and Courier Relay

Implementation: `src/core/nostr/gift-wrap.ts` and `courier-relay.ts`.

## Key Distinction: Nostr Keys vs BLE Keys

Airhop identity uses three key systems, all rooted in one stored key pair:

| Key          | Curve     | Used for                                       |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Noise static | X25519    | BLE session encryption (Noise XX)              |
| Signing key  | Ed25519   | Packet, board, prekey, and group-state signing |
| Nostr key    | secp256k1 | Nostr events, derived from the signing key     |

The Ed25519 signing key is **not** the Nostr key. Nostr uses secp256k1 (Schnorr), so the `npub` cannot be the Ed25519 public key. Use `deriveNostrPrivKey(ed25519PrivKey)` to derive a deterministic secp256k1 key from the Ed25519 identity key via HKDF-SHA256. Only the Ed25519 and X25519 keys are stored; the Nostr key is re-derived, so there is no third key pair to manage.

Location channels derive a further per-geohash secp256k1 identity from the same signing key, so presence in one cell cannot be linked to another.

```typescript
// src/core/nostr/gift-wrap.ts
export function deriveNostrPrivKey(ed25519PrivKey: Uint8Array): Uint8Array {
  const info = new TextEncoder().encode("airhop-nostr-key-v1");
  return hkdf(sha256, ed25519PrivKey, undefined, info, 32);
}
```

## NIP-59 Gift-Wrap: Three-Layer Structure

### Send flow

```
plaintext
  -> Rumor  (kind 14, unsigned)          built with sender's real pubkey
  -> Seal   (kind 13, signed by sender)  encrypts rumor with NIP-44 to recipient
  -> Gift wrap (kind 1059, ephemeral)    encrypts seal with NIP-44, throwaway key
```

### Layer 1: Rumor (kind 14)

An `UnsignedEvent`. Never signed, per NIP-17 a rumor must not have a signature.

```typescript
{
  kind: 14,
  pubkey: senderPubkey,      // sender's real secp256k1 pubkey
  created_at: now,
  tags: [],                  // as bitchat: the gift wrap's `p` tag targets the recipient
  content: plaintextMessage,
}
```

### Layer 2: Seal (kind 13)

Signed by the **sender's real key**. This is intentional: it authenticates the sender to the recipient, while the outer gift wrap hides that identity from relay operators.

```typescript
const conversationKey = nip44.getConversationKey(
  senderPrivKey,
  recipientPubkeyHex,
);
content = nip44.encrypt(JSON.stringify(rumor), conversationKey);
// event is signed with senderPrivKey
```

### Layer 3: Gift Wrap (kind 1059)

Signed by a freshly generated throwaway key. The ephemeral key's pubkey becomes the gift wrap's `pubkey` field. Relay operators see the throwaway pubkey, not the real sender.

```typescript
const ephemeralPrivKey = generateSecretKey(); // new key every send
const wrapConvKey = nip44.getConversationKey(
  ephemeralPrivKey,
  recipientPubkeyHex,
);
content = nip44.encrypt(JSON.stringify(sealEvent), wrapConvKey);
// Seal and wrap timestamps are randomized +/-15 minutes (bitchat's window, not NIP-59's two days)
```

### Receive flow

```
1. Decrypt gift wrap using recipient key + gift wrap pubkey field
2. Verify seal signature (rejects forged DMs)
3. Decrypt seal using recipient key + seal pubkey field
4. Check the rumor is a well-formed kind 14 (nostr-tools validateEvent) and that seal.pubkey === rumor.pubkey (prevents identity substitution)
5. Check the rumor's created_at is inside the subscription's lookback and at most 15 minutes ahead (15 minutes of skew either side)
```

Step 2 is security-critical. Skipping it means anyone who knows the recipient's pubkey can forge DMs.

There is no recipient-tag check on the rumor. The recipient binding comes from the seal encryption: the seal is NIP-44 encrypted to the recipient's key, so a rumor meant for anyone else cannot be opened. The rumor is unsigned, so nothing else checks its shape: a missing or non-numeric `created_at` would slip past every time comparison, which is why step 4 runs `validateEvent` first.

## Courier Relay (kind 1401)

When BLE delivery fails, sealed courier envelopes are parked on Nostr relays. The recipient polls when they come online.

### Event Format

```
kind:    1401
tags:    [["x", recipientTagHex], ["expiration", unixSecString]]
content: base64(encodeEnvelopePayload(envelope))
```

The `x` tag is a 16-byte HMAC-derived daily recipient tag (see `computeRecipientTag` in `courier-store.ts`). It rotates daily. This is not unlinkability: anyone holding the peer's static key can compute its tag for any day.

The event is signed by a throwaway key minted per publish, never the device identity: the envelope authenticates its sender inside the Noise X seal, and a stable publisher key would make every drop attributable to one npub. bitchat mints per publish too.

NIP-40 compliant relays auto-expire the event at the `expiration` timestamp. Non-compliant relays keep it; the recipient ignores stale envelopes.

### Subscription Filter

Subscribers query by `#x` tag with their current and previous day's tags:

```typescript
{ kinds: [1401], "#x": [todayTagHex, ...], since: now - 86400, limit: 100 }
```

The limit is bitchat-ios's (`courierDrops`, limit 100). It bounds a flood rather than honest volume, since anyone who heard an announce can compute the daily tag and park junk after real mail. There is no paging with `until`, as in bitchat-ios: a flood can outrun any page budget, and every junk page costs Schnorr checks.

## Subscribing Across Relays

`NostrClient.subscribe` opens one `subscribeMany([url], ...)` per relay and per filter, each with its own filter copy, and `queryEvents` runs one `querySync` per relay and merges by event ID. nostr-tools records an event ID as seen before verifying its signature, in a set shared across the relays of one call, so a hostile relay's forged copy with the genuine ID would suppress every honest relay's copy; and a rejected far-future event from one relay would move the shared `since` another relay reconnects with. Airhop keeps its own set of delivered IDs per `subscribe()` call, recorded only after verification and only when the event was actually queued, and hands it to nostr-tools as a lookup-only `alreadyHaveEvent`. Collapse back to one call when a nostr-tools release carries PR #560.

## Event Kind Summary

| Kind | Name         | Signed by         |
| ---- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 14   | Rumor        | Nobody (unsigned) |
| 13   | Seal         | Real sender key   |
| 1059 | Gift wrap    | Ephemeral key     |
| 1401 | Courier drop | Throwaway key     |

## What Not to Do

- Do not sign the rumor (kind 14). It must stay as `UnsignedEvent`.
- Do not reuse the ephemeral key across gift wraps. Generate a fresh one every time.
- Do not use the Ed25519 signing key directly with `nostr-tools`; derive the secp256k1 key first.
- Do not skip seal signature verification on receive (`verifyEvent(seal)`).

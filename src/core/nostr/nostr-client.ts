//
// Connects to 3-5 relays simultaneously. Publish uses first-ACK-wins: the
// event is sent to all relays and the promise resolves on the first OK.
//
// Relay selection: caller provides the relay list. Use geo-relay.ts to pick
// the closest relays. A fixed set of default gift-wrap relays is always
// included for DM delivery.
//
// Tor proxy: this client never touches the socket directly. Routing Nostr
// through Tor is done one level up, by swapping nostr-tools' WebSocket
// implementation (see tor-routing.ts): on iOS for TorWebSocket, which tunnels
// over Arti's SOCKS5 proxy, and on Android by the proxy installed into the
// shared OkHttp client every socket is built from.
//
// Auto-reconnect covers a relay that drops after connecting, and only that.
// nostr-tools never retries a relay whose first connect fails: it is dropped,
// with its subscriptions, for the life of this client. So callers build a
// client only once there is a route for it, and build a new one when the
// network comes back.

// Geohash presence heartbeats: kind 20001 ephemeral Nostr events.
//
// When the user has location permission, GeohashPresence broadcasts a kind
// 20001 event to the geohash channel(s) that cover their current location,
// on each cell's own relays. The event carries the cell in a `g` tag and an
// empty body. Subscribers learn that the sender's Nostr pubkey is in that cell.
//
// Privacy: presence is only broadcast at precision-5 (~5 km x 5 km) and
// coarser cells: never at precision 6+ which would reveal exact location.
// Presence heartbeats are ephemeral (kind 2xxxx in Nostr) and are not
// persisted by relays.
//
// Heartbeat interval: 40-80 s (jittered) matching bitchat-ios behavior.

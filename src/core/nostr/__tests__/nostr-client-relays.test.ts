// Which relays NostrClient actually contacts.
//
// The bug these cover: a custom relay added while geo-relay discovery was on
// (the default) was never contacted. mergeGeoRelays appends custom relays after
// the cell's interop set, and NostrClient re-capped every per-call relay list to
// the size of the default DM pool (5). A geo set is already exactly 5, so the
// cap trimmed precisely the user's entries. The settings row read "1 added" and
// nothing ever opened a socket to it.
//
// mergeGeoRelays was unit-tested and correct (see geo-relay.test.ts, "interop
// relays never dropped"); the contract broke one layer down. So these assert the
// relays NostrClient targets, not the ones the caller asked for.

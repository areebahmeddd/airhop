// Inbound relay traffic must never hold the JS thread.
//
// The field report these cover: a fresh install with WiFi on froze on the Mesh
// screen. The radar's sonar loop pulsed once and stopped, the tab bar answered
// nothing, and a relaunch sat on a black screen - all of which are what a
// blocked JS thread looks like from the outside. With WiFi off the same build
// was fine, because with no relay reachable none of the traffic arrived.
//
// Two things caused it, and both are fixed separately. The volume was a
// deletion filter asking for everything a relay held (geohash-channel-service).
// The shape was this: handlers ran inline on the socket callback, so however
// much arrived at once ran as one unbroken block of JS with no frame in
// between.
//
// These assert the shape. The properties that matter are that nothing is
// dispatched synchronously from the socket callback, that a burst is spread
// across turns rather than run as one, that order survives, and that a handler
// which throws does not strand the queue behind it.

// A v2 packet may carry an explicit hop list between sender and recipient
// (`[count:u8][hop:8]...`, decoded by packet-codec into `route`). A relay named
// in that list forwards to the next name instead of flooding.
//
// Airhop follows routes but never originates them. Following is cheap and
// keeps us from being a node other implementations have to route around.
// Originating would require a topology, and the only source of one is the
// `directNeighbors` TLV (`0x04`): every node publishing, in cleartext, who it
// is connected to. For an app built for protests and blackouts, that hands the
// social graph of a room to any nearby radio to save relay bandwidth. bitchat's
// own peer-ID rotation analysis reaches the same conclusion about their client.
// So we emit no `0x04`, build no topology, and attach no routes; flooding is
// the documented fallback either way.

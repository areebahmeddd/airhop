// Routing rules per PROTOCOLS.md section 4:
//   - Every incoming packet whose packet ID has not been seen is relayed.
//   - TTL is decremented before relay; packets with TTL = 0 are dropped.
//   - Relay is delayed by a random jitter (10-220 ms) to prevent cascade storms.
//   - Duplicate packets (same ID within 5 min) are dropped silently.
//
// Packet ID matches bitchat PacketIdUtil:
// SHA-256(type|senderID|timestamp|payload)[0:16]
//
// The router does not know about encryption, signatures, or message types.
// Callers are responsible for verifying signatures before passing a packet in.

// Payload compression, byte-identical to bitchat's CompressionUtil.
//
// bitchat compresses payloads with raw DEFLATE (RFC 1951, no zlib header) and
// stores the original size so the receiver can restore it. iOS uses Apple's
// COMPRESSION_ZLIB, Android uses java.util.zip.Deflater at DEFAULT_COMPRESSION
// with nowrap=true; both are reference zlib.
//
// The output must match theirs byte for byte, because signing and verification
// both re-encode the packet, so verification re-compresses. A different encoder
// produces a different signing blob and a signature that will not verify even
// though the payload is identical. DEFLATE output is not canonical: any
// conforming encoder emits a valid stream, but not the same bytes. pako's
// original hash does not match reference zlib; `legacyHash: false` selects the
// one that does, and it is set explicitly so parity does not ride on a default.

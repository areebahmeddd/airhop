// Push-to-talk voice capture: encodes audio into VOICE_FRAME (0x29) packets.
//
// Architecture: audio capture is delegated to an AudioCaptureBackend interface.

// raw PCM callbacks; this module handles PTT session state, frame sequencing,
// and packet construction.
//
// VOICE_FRAME payload format (matches bitchat VoiceBurstPacket.swift):
//   [burstID: 8 bytes][seq: u16 BE][flags: u8][type-specific payload]
//
//   flags 0x01 (START):    payload = [codec: u8]
//   flags 0x00 (DATA):     payload = [len: u16 BE][AAC frame]... (1+ frames)
//   flags 0x02 (END):      payload = [totalDataPackets: u16 BE][durationMs: u32 BE]
//   flags 0x04 (CANCELED): payload empty; receivers discard the burst
//
// seq 0 is reserved for the START packet. DATA packets start at seq 1.
// Codec 0x01 = AAC-LC 16 kHz mono (matches VoiceBurstCodec.aacLC16kMono).
//
// START is sent with the first captured frame, not when the button goes down.
// A burst is only real once there is audio in it, and announcing one before the
// microphone has produced anything is what turns a failed capture into a live
// bubble on the far side that never plays. See sendStartIfNeeded.
//
// DATA packets batch multiple encoded frames (each prefixed with a u16 length)
// into a single VOICE_FRAME packet up to PTT_MAX_BURST_BYTES (210 bytes) so
// the packet never needs BLE fragmentation.

// Gossip sync replays old packets by design: a peer returning from a partition
// asks for what it missed, and the answer is stale by definition. A blanket
// freshness window would refuse those answers, and no window at all leaves
// every packet replayable by anyone who recorded one.
//
// The exemption is attributed by the receiver rather than asserted by the
// sender. We register every REQUEST_SYNC against the peer we sent it to, and a
// response carrying IS_RSR skips the freshness window only if it comes from a
// peer we asked, inside the window. Everything else is held to +/-2 minutes.
//
// This is why requests are unicast: a broadcast request has no peer to register
// against, so nothing it draws back can be attributed.

// How long a request stays answerable. Matches bitchat's 30s responseWindow:
// long enough for a responder to diff its whole store and stream the misses
// back over a congested link, short enough that a recorded response is useless
// by the time it could be replayed.

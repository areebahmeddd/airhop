// `verifyTokenOffline`: the only check between a forged token and the balance

// proof, using its public keys alone.

// "invalid" (provably forged) is refused outright. "unchecked" (cannot tell)
// is stored unverified and redeemed at the first chance. Collapsing unchecked
// into invalid breaks every offline transfer; into valid, it credits forgeries.

// A valid witness needs the mint's private keys, so acceptance is covered end

//
// This is what turns a failed panic wipe from permanent into a retry. The wipe
// most likely to fail is the one that matters: `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK` refuses
// reads and deletes on a phone that has booted but not been unlocked, which is
// exactly the seizure the gesture exists for. Without a retry the keys stay for
// good. The next launch is past that unlock, where the same delete usually just
// works.
//
// Not framed as "retry the wipe", because it does not need to know a wipe ever
// happened - which is the point. A secret with no identity to own it has no
// owner and no reader; deleting it is unconditionally correct, so this needs no
// persisted "a wipe was attempted here" flag, and a wipe leaves no trace of
// having been attempted.
//
// The identity itself is deliberately NOT swept, and the reason is a race rather
// than a scruple. The caller runs this without waiting, on its way to showing
// the welcome screen, and the very next thing onboarding does is WRITE an
// identity. A delete still in flight when that lands would destroy the key the
// user just created, leaving an app that cannot start - a far worse outcome than
// the one this exists to fix. Nothing is lost by skipping it: the caller only
// reaches here because loadIdentity found no identity, so there is nothing to
// delete, and in the one case where there might be (a read that failed while the
// item survived) a keychain refusing reads refuses deletes too.
//
// Nor is the wallet's file key: the wallet partition opens under it at launch
// on every install, identity or not, and deleting it leaves that partition
// writing under a key the next launch cannot find. It guards nothing a wipe has
// not already cleared.
//
// Returns true ONLY when a leftover is positively confirmed: the delete was
// refused AND a read afterwards still hands back a value. A keychain that
// refuses both is unreadable rather than dirty, and claiming otherwise would put
// an alarm about data at rest in front of someone whose device is merely locked.

// The launch sweep that makes a failed panic wipe retry itself.
//
// The wipe most likely to fail is the one that matters. Items are stored
// AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK, so a phone that has booted but not been unlocked refuses
// both deletes and reads - which is exactly the seizure the gesture exists for.
// Nothing used to try again: the wipe failed once, said so in an alert, and the
// keys stayed for the life of the device.
//
// The properties that matter:
//   * A launch with no identity deletes the secrets that no longer have an
//     owner, because with no identity none of them does.
//   * The identity is never touched. The sweep is not awaited, and onboarding
//     writes an identity moments later; a delete still in flight would destroy
//     the key the user just created.
//   * "Leftovers" is only ever claimed when one is positively read back. A
//     keychain that refuses everything is unreadable, not dirty, and saying
//     otherwise would put an alarm about data at rest in front of somebody
//     whose phone is merely locked.
//   * A first install - the overwhelmingly common case - is a silent no-op.

                  An absolutely positioned child is laid out against its parent's
                  PADDING box, so `bottom: 0` sits under the outer SafeAreaView's

                  is a few points and the pill's own margin hid the difference;
                  with three-button navigation it is around 48, and the system
                  buttons drew straight over the tab bar. Consuming the inset
                  here puts it back on top.

                  Not the `useSafeAreaInsets` hook: the provider is rendered
                  inside this component, so a hook call in its body would sit
                  ABOVE the provider and throw. This element is a descendant, so

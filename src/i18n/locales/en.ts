// English: the source of truth for every other locale.
//
// `locales/types.ts` derives `TranslationKey` and `PluralKey` from this file, and
// every locale is annotated with them, so a key added here is a compile error
// elsewhere until it is filled in. There is no runtime fallback.
//
// Sections follow the app: shell, onboarding, chats, mesh, wallet, contacts,
// settings. Keys are flat and dotted, `<area>.<screen>.<thing>`.
//
// Rules, all enforced by `__tests__/catalog.test.ts` unless noted:
//
//   Punctuation      Having started a second sentence, finish it. Titles,
//                    buttons and one-line row subtitles take no full stop;
//                    modal bodies and anything reaching two sentences take one
//                    on every sentence. Every catalog follows this in its own
//                    script's punctuation.
//   Placeholders     Named (`{count}`), never positional. Anything inside them
//                    is user content and is never translated.
//   Plurals          Through `tPlural`, never by appending to a stem. Counts
//                    measured in bytes say so: a UTF-8 budget is not characters,
//                    since one emoji spends four.
//   Never in here    Anything that crosses the wire or derives an identity: the
//                    username word lists, the transmitted /hug and /slap text
//                    (bitchat matches it as an English substring), command
//                    tokens, channel names, geohashes, user content, licence
//                    texts. Localise the hint describing a command, never the
//                    command. The wordmark "airhop" is drawn as part of the
//                    brand mark and is never translated or transliterated, and
//                    the endonyms in src/i18n/languages.ts stay in their own
//                    script.
//   US English       Spelling and grammar, not units: distances stay metric.
//   Typography       Typographic apostrophes and quotes, never straight ones.
//   Never claim      That Android needs location to find Bluetooth devices (the
//                    manifest asserts neverForLocation on BLUETOOTH_SCAN), or
//                    that clearing the cache can retrieve a file again (there is
//                    no request-that-file protocol). Both mislead about what the
//                    app can do.

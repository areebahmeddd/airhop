//   Emptiness     `""` type-checks and renders as a missing label.
//   Plural shape  Every category but `other` is optional on `PluralForms`, so a
//                 catalog missing the forms its language needs compiles.
//   Placeholders  One nothing fills renders as literal "{peer}" on a lock screen.
//   Frozen text   Some strings cross the wire, so translating them breaks
//                 interop, not layout.
//   Punctuation   A string that stops mid-thought reads as truncated and runs
//                 two halves together on a screen reader.
//
// Written against the registry, not English, so every rule reaches every
// catalog automatically.

// Location-scoped channels bridged over Nostr.
//
// This is what makes #block / #neighborhood / #city / #province / #region mean
// something. Until now they were BLE-only broadcasts despite being described in
// the UI as "bridged over Nostr", so two people in the same city but out of
// Bluetooth range could sit in #city and never see each other.
//
// How it works:
//   - The device's coarse position is truncated to a geohash. Each channel maps
//     to a precision, so "#city" resolves to a ~5 km cell and "#region" to a
//     ~1250 km one.
//   - Messages are published as ephemeral Nostr events tagged with that
//     geohash, and we subscribe to the same tag. Anyone whose position falls in
//     the same cell shares the channel.
//   - Relays are chosen by distance from the user, so a city channel is carried
//     by relays near that city rather than whatever is hardcoded.
//
// Privacy: raw coordinates NEVER leave the device. Only the truncated geohash
// is published, and the finest cell we ever publish is ~150 m across. Presence
// heartbeats are additionally restricted to coarse precisions by geohash-presence.ts.
//
// Degradation: with location denied, the NAMED channels resolve to no cell and
// keep working over BLE exactly as before. Location is an enhancement, never a
// requirement. Teleported channels (geohash:<gh>) carry a fixed geohash, so
// they stay live over the internet even with no location fix.

  // radar's sonar loop stopped between pulses, the tab bar stopped answering,
  // and turning WiFi off "fixed" it because with no relay reachable the flood

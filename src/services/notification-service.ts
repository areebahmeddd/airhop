// Message notifications: local system notifications for inbound messages.
//
// "Local" is the whole point. There is no push server and no FCM: notifications
// are raised by the running app process the moment a message lands over any
// transport (BLE, WiFi, courier, Nostr), which keeps the no-central-servers
// ethos intact. On Android the foreground service keeps that process alive in
// the background so this still fires when the app is not on screen; on iOS it
// fires whenever the OS has the app awake (a BLE wake, or in the foreground).
//
// The pure decisions (whether to notify, and the text) live in
// notification-policy.ts. This module owns the platform side effects and the
// small amount of module-level state the policy needs: whether the app is
// foregrounded, and which conversation is currently open.

// Orchestrated panic wipe: clears all keys and message data in one call.
//
// This is the single entry point for the "triple-tap logo" wipe gesture and
// any other UI surface that needs to destroy user data. It:
//   1. Removes every private key from the OS keychain via core/crypto/keychain.
//   2. Clears all MMKV storage instances (messages, peer state, etc.).
//   3. Deletes received media files from the cache (photos, videos, voice
//      notes), which live on disk, not in MMKV, and would otherwise survive.
//
// This takes real time on a device with real data on it, and two rules follow
// from that: every step that can stall is time-boxed, and the sequence is
// resumable if the process dies partway through (see ./wipe-marker).
//
// After this call the app is left in an empty, first-run state.
// A restart will trigger key regeneration at next launch.

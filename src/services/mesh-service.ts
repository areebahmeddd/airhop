// Mesh wiring service.
//
// Bridges the native transport modules (BLE, WiFi Aware, LAN) to the core
// TypeScript engine. One singleton instance is created after identity
// generation and lives for the app's lifetime.
//
// Responsibilities:
//   - Start BLE advertising (peripheral) + scanning (central)
//   - Start the WiFi Aware and LAN (mDNS + TCP) transports where available
//   - Send periodic ANNOUNCE packets via AnnounceManager
//   - Receive raw bytes, reassemble fragments, and route inner packets
//   - Dispatch ANNOUNCE payloads to PeerStore (UI layer)
//   - Dispatch CHANNEL_MSG, NOISE_ENCRYPTED, DR_ENCRYPTED to ChatStore
//   - Expose sendChannelMessage(), sendDm(), sendAttachment() for feature layer

// Wallet service: the single place that talks to Cashu mints.
//
// Every screen (Wallet tab, DM thread, peer sheet) goes through here, so the
// rules that protect real money live in one file instead of being re-derived in
// three UIs. A screen that open-codes "pick proofs, serialise, delete them from
// the store" destroys value on any crash between the delete and the delivery.
//
// Guarantees this module provides
//  1. Proofs are never deleted to send. They are moved into a reserved bucket
//     against a transaction id and only dropped once delivery is confirmed, so
//     an interrupted send is always recoverable (`reclaimSend`).
//  2. Nothing is credited to the balance without either a mint swap or a
//     passing DLEQ check; anything credited offline is marked unverified and
//     redeemed first when connectivity returns.
//  3. A mint call is never made silently over the clear net while the user has
//     Tor on (iOS), because Arti only wraps WebSockets, not fetch.
//  4. Units are never mixed. A (mint, unit) pair is one account.
//
// Offline is the normal case, not the error case: `getWallet` builds a fully
// functional wallet from the cached keysets, so fee maths, proof selection and
// DLEQ verification all work with the radio off. Only swap, mint and melt
// actually need the network.

// forever. That is not an abstract worry on mobile: captive portals, a dropped
// cell handover and an overloaded mint all produce exactly that shape.
//
// A hang is worse than a failure here, because the UI is built around promises
// settling. A stuck request leaves the confirm button spinning, holds the
// per-mint refresh lock so every other mint is unrefreshable, and stalls the
// startup chain before the nutzap watcher is ever installed. A timeout turns
// all of that into an ordinary error the user can retry.

// On Android there is nothing to refuse. The proxy is installed into the OkHttp
// client this request is built from, so it is inside the tunnel whenever Tor is
// on and simply fails when no circuit exists. Refusing would take the wallet
// away to prevent a leak that cannot happen.
//
// On iOS, Tor is wired only into the Nostr WebSocket; a plain fetch bypasses it
// entirely. Silently making the request there would tell the mint exactly who is
// swapping which proofs, which is the one thing a Tor user is trying to avoid,
// so it is refused unless they have explicitly allowed it.
// Gated on the user's PREFERENCE, not on whether a circuit happens to be up
// right now, and the difference is a real leak rather than a nicety.
//
// `torActive` is a claim about this instant. `torEnabled` is what the user
// asked for and what their toggle still shows. Those two diverge in exactly one
// state, and it is the worst one: iOS revalidation deliberately stands the claim
// down while keeping the preference on, because a failed bootstrap is usually
// transient and the socket must stay Tor-only rather than falling back to the
// clear net. In that state the Nostr side is still hard-routed through Arti, the
// switch still reads on, the user still believes they are covered - and reading
// `torActive` alone opened this gate and put mint HTTP on the clear net with the
// device's real IP. That is precisely the linkage the gate exists to prevent,
// and it happened only when Tor was struggling, which is when it matters most.
//
// Either flag being set is enough to refuse. Overshooting costs a mint call the
// user can allow explicitly; undershooting costs them the anonymity they think
// they have. `version-screen.tsx` already gates its update check on
// `torEnabled`, so this also stops the two network gates disagreeing.

//
//   1. prepare   local. Picks the inputs and builds the blinded outputs.

// means. This returns the live preview and its storable form together so the

// to work in a dead zone. They are not ordinary balance though: a transaction
// names them, and only its replay can learn from the mint what became of them.

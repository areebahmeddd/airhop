// Paying a person, in one place.
//
// Four screens can pay someone: the DM thread's attach menu, the contact info
// sheet, the Mesh tab's peer sheet, and the Wallet tab's Zap. All four go through
// `payPerson`, which owns the whole ladder, so they cannot disagree about what a
// payment does, which rail carried it, or whether it can be reclaimed:
//
//   1. Radio, when a direct link exists. Instant, local, needs no internet, and
//      reclaimable. Someone standing in front of you should not wait on a mint.
//   2. Nutzap (NIP-61), when there is no radio link but we know their Nostr key,
//      they have published a kind 10019, and we hold value at a mint they
//      accept. The proofs are locked to their key, so this is the only rail
//      where the money is definitively theirs whether or not they ever come
//      online. It is also the only rail that cannot be taken back.
//   3. An ordinary token, delivered by `MeshService.sendDm`, which picks its own
//      best transport (Nostr gift-wrap, courier, or the outbox). Reclaimable.
//   4. A token string the user hands over themselves. Reclaimable.
//
// Rails 3 and 4 keep the guarantee the wallet service was built around: proofs
// are reserved, not spent, and a send that never lands can be pulled back.
//
// Every rail reports which one it was and whether it can be undone. That is not
// decoration: "locked to them forever" and "queued, take it back whenever" are
// the same gesture to the user and completely different facts about their money.

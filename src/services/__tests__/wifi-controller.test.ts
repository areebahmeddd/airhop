// The WiFi fast path used to be one unretried call with its error thrown away.
// These cases are the three field reports that produced the reconciler, plus
// the two ways a reconciler can be worse than nothing if it gets the
// permanent/transient split wrong.
//
// The properties that matter:
//   * A device that CAN run the fast path eventually does, whatever order the
//     radio and the permission arrive in.
//   * A device that CANNOT is asked exactly once. The BLE side learned this the
//     expensive way, retrying an unsupported advertiser every five seconds for
//     the life of the process.
//   * Losing the radio is recoverable. This is the one the old code could not
//     do at all: native latched itself "started" over a dead session and every
//     later start resolved instantly having done nothing.

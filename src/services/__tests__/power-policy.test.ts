// The power policy decides how hard the radios run. It is a pure function of
// four facts, which is the whole reason it lives in TypeScript rather than in
// the native module: the decision is testable here, and native keeps only the
// mechanism.
//
// Two properties matter more than any individual mapping:
//   * A pocketed phone never runs flat out. That is where the battery goes.
//   * The mode does not oscillate. Every change restarts the scanner, so a
//     policy that flaps costs more than it saves.

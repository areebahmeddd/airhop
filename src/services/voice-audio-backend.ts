// Platform audio for live push-to-talk: the two backends that voice-capture.ts
// and voice-player.ts are written against, implemented on top of the native
// AirhopVoice module.
//
// Everything above these two classes is platform-agnostic and already tested:
// the burst wire format, the jitter buffer, the relay policy. Everything below
// them is AudioRecord/MediaCodec on Android and AVAudioEngine/AVAudioConverter
// on iOS. This file is the seam, and it is deliberately thin.
//
// If the native module is missing (a platform where it did not register), `isLiveVoiceAvailable` reports false and the app keeps using
// voice notes. Live voice degrading to a voice note is a designed fallback, not
// a failure: the whole feature is an optimisation of a gesture that already
// works.

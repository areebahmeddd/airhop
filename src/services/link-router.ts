// What an Airhop link does once it has been parsed.
//
// There are two ways one arrives: the OS hands it to us because the user tapped
// it somewhere else (App.tsx), or the user pastes it into the Join sheet. Both
// are the same act of consent and must have the same effect, so the effect
// lives here rather than in either caller. Everything is a pure consequence of
// the link plus the stores; the caller only decides where to navigate.
//
// Parsing stays in utils/deep-link (pure, no crypto). This module owns the side
// effects, which is why it lives with the services.

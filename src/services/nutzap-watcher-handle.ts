// and on, constructs a new client and leaves the old subscription pointing at a
// closed pool. Were it installed only at startup, either toggle would silently
// end NIP-61 for the rest of the session, and incoming nutzaps would stop being
// redeemed with nothing to say so.

// raises, and called by the mesh service after it builds a transport. The
// indirection is what keeps mesh-service from importing the wallet layer.

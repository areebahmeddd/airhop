// Notification policy: the pure decisions behind message notifications.
//
// Free of any platform API so it is trivially unit-testable and so the rules
// live in one obvious place. notification-service.ts owns the side effects
// (presenting, dismissing, badging); this file only answers "should we, and
// with what text".
//
// "With what text" is why the translation runtime is imported here. That is a
// pure catalog lookup, not a platform call: the strings are plain TypeScript
// compiled into the bundle, and the one native read behind it (the device's
// language list) is mocked in tests and falls back to English if it throws. The
// decisions above it stay independent of it either way.

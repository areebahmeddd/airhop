// The one place that decides whether the WiFi Aware fast path should be
// running, and makes reality match.
//
// Both platforms, one reconciler: nothing below asks which it is driving. What
// differs is which failures each can report, and every one is a `code` rather
// than a platform check.
//
// The one structural difference is the pairing gate: Apple's Wi-Fi Aware has no
// unpaired mode, so on iOS this will not attach until a device is paired. See
// `setPairedCount`.
//
// This is radio-controller.ts's counterpart, and it exists for the same reason
// that one does. WiFi was started exactly once per MeshService.start(), like
// this:
//
//     NativeAirhopWiFi?.startWiFi().catch(() => {});
//
// One attempt, no retry, and the rejection code - the only thing that says
// WHICH of eight failures happened - discarded before anything could read it.
// Every failure mode the BLE reconciler was written to eliminate was still
// fully present here:
//
//   1. WiFi switched off when the mesh started meant the attach was refused,
//      swallowed, and never retried. Turning WiFi on afterwards changed
//      nothing for the rest of the process, because nothing was watching and
//      nothing was going to ask again.
//   2. NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES granted a moment after the mesh started (the
//      ordinary first-install race, and the reason the BLE controller has a
//      backoff at all) left the fast path dead on a device that was entitled
//      to it.
//   3. WiFi toggled off mid-session tore the sockets down natively, and the
//      module latched itself into a "started" state it could not leave, so
//      even an explicit restart resolved instantly having done nothing.
//
// The shape that fixes all three is the same reconciler the radios already use:
// a DESIRED state, an OBSERVED outcome, and one idempotent pass that closes the
// gap and schedules a retry when it cannot.
//
// What is deliberately different from the BLE controller:
//
//   * No BLOCKER is published. WiFi Aware is an extra link between two phones on
//     the same platform, and BLE carries everything either way. A user whose
//     WiFi is off has not lost the mesh, and saying they have would be a false
//     alarm on the one screen that must stay trustworthy.
//
//     What it does report, through `onState`, is which of those situations it is
//     in, so the Mesh tab can say the fast path is off in the same neutral voice
//     it uses for battery saver. Worth saying at all because an attachment over
//     BLE alone drops fragments and retries, which reads as the app being slow.
//   * "Unsupported" is latched forever rather than retried. No hardware, or an
//     API level below the data path, is not a state a device leaves.

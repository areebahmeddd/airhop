// A phone camera produces several megabytes. The wire limit is 512 KiB
// (bitchat's FileTransferLimits, mirrored in bitchat-file-packet), and at
// Bluetooth's ~18 KiB/s even a file that fits takes half a minute, so sending
// the original is not something anyone wants even where it would be allowed.
// Every messenger resizes before sending for exactly this reason; this is that
// step, and nothing more.
//
// It changes nothing on the wire. The result is an ordinary JPEG in an ordinary
// FILE_TRANSFER packet, so a bitchat peer sees a photo it already knew how to
// read. The only difference is that it now arrives.
//
// Deliberately never throws: a photo that cannot be resized is still worth
// trying to send at its original size, where the size check in
// FileTransferService gives the sender a reason about their photo rather than a
// failure from inside an image library.

// The one place that decides whether the BLE radios should be running, and
// makes reality match.
//
// One owner, because callers issuing native radio calls on their own authority
// and swallowing the results cannot agree on what state the radios are in. Three
// failures this design exists to prevent:
//
//   1. A permission grant is visible to the app before the Bluetooth stack
//      honours it. Calls issued in that window threw SecurityException, were
//      swallowed by `.catch(() => {})`, and nothing retried - so a fresh
//      install sat with both radios dead behind a UI claiming everything was
//      fine, until the user force-quit and relaunched.
//   2. On iOS, every CBManager state callback was reported to JS as a radio
//      change, which scheduled a restart, which constructed a new CBManager,
//      which fired a state callback. Fourteen central and fourteen peripheral
//      managers were allocated in ten seconds on an idle phone.
//   3. Going Invisible called stopAdvertising(), which on Android also tore
//      down the foreground service, silently ending background operation for a
//      mesh that was still meant to be scanning and relaying.
//
// The shape that fixes all three is a reconciler, not a set of commands:
//
//   - There is a DESIRED state (running? discoverable?) and a set of DEVICE
//     FACTS (radio on? permission held? location services on?).
//   - reconcile() computes the single reason we cannot run, publishes it, and
//     issues only the native calls needed to close the gap.
//   - It is idempotent. Calling it when nothing has changed does nothing, which
//     is what makes it safe to call from an event handler, a resume, a timer,
//     and a user tap without any of them needing to know about the others.
//   - Native calls that cannot succeed REJECT with a reason rather than
//     resolving into the void, and a rejection schedules a retry with backoff
//     instead of being discarded.
//
// The backoff is deliberately not a fixed sleep. bitchat-android waits a flat
// second after granting permissions ("This solves the issue where app needs
// restart to work on first install", MainActivity.kt). A flat wait is both
// too long on a fast device and too short on a slow one; retrying until the
// stack actually accepts the call is correct on every device and instant on
// most.

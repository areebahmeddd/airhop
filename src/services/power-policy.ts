// How hard the radios should work, given what the device can afford.
//
// Airhop scans and advertises at the most aggressive settings the platform
// offers - LOW_LATENCY both ways, TX_POWER_HIGH - and did so identically whether
// the app was on screen or pocketed, and whether the phone was at 100% or 4%.
// Continuous LOW_LATENCY scanning is roughly an order of magnitude more
// expensive than LOW_POWER, and for an app whose whole purpose is running in a
// pocket all day it is the single largest battery cost there is.
//
// The bands and the mode table follow bitchat-android's PowerProfileResolver
// (mesh/PowerManager.kt) deliberately: it is the reference implementation for
// this protocol, its thresholds are field-tested, and inventing different
// numbers would be guessing. Two things are ours:
//
//   * Hysteresis. bitchat re-resolves on every ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED, which
//     fires on every 1% step. A phone sitting at 20% while discharging, or
//     wobbling either side of it while charging, would flip modes repeatedly -
//     and every flip restarts the scanner, which costs more than it saves.
//   * The policy lives in TypeScript rather than in the native module, because
//     the radios are already owned by one reconciler (radio-controller.ts) and
//     "how hard" belongs next to "whether at all". It also makes the decision a
//     pure function, so it is tested here rather than on a device.
//
// Native keeps only the mechanism: it observes the battery, reports it, and
// applies whichever mode it is told. No policy on that side.

//
//   * Background dominates everything. Off screen, nobody is waiting on
//     discovery latency, so there is no reason to pay for it - and this is where
//     a phone spends almost all of its day.
//   * The OS power-saving switch beats charging and a healthy battery. It is
//     the user saying outright to spend less, where charging and the battery
//     level are only inferences about what they can afford. Android turns it
//     off on the charger by default, so the two rarely meet.
//   * Charging beats battery level. Plugged in, the cost is somebody else's.
//   * Otherwise the battery band decides.
//
// Foreground on battery is BALANCED rather than PERFORMANCE on purpose: a
// balanced scan still discovers peers in seconds, which is fast enough for
// somebody watching the Mesh tab, and reserving the most expensive setting for
// "plugged in" is what keeps the app from being the reason a phone dies.

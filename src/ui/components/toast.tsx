// A brief confirmation pill: "Saved to your photos", and anything else where
// the user did something small and deserves to see that it worked.
//
// Sits between the two things this app already had and neither of which fits.
// An alert dialog demands a tap for news nobody needs to acknowledge; the muted
// status strip above the compose bar is quiet enough to miss, and it is behind
// a full-screen photo when the action was taken from there. So: same pill the
// Undo Send window uses (surface fill, hairline border, fully rounded), floated
// over whatever it is confirming, gone on its own.
//
// Positioned absolutely inside its parent rather than mounted globally, because
// the one place it is needed most is inside a Modal, and a globally mounted
// toast renders behind those.

// The one bottom sheet in the app.
//
// Every sheet in the app goes through this one: channel info, contact info, the
// attach picker, the wallet's send and receive panels. A hand-rolled Modal per
// sheet drifts in behaviour and usually ships a grab handle that ignores the
// finger, and an affordance that does nothing reads as broken.
//
// This owns the parts that must never differ between sheets:
//
//   * the scrim, whose opacity tracks the sheet's position so a half-dragged
//     sheet shows a half-lit backdrop rather than a full one,
//   * a real drag: the sheet follows your finger and dismisses on either a long
//     enough pull or a fast enough flick, springing back otherwise,
//   * keyboard avoidance, since a sheet with a text field in it is the single
//     most common place for the keyboard to swallow the thing you're typing in,
//   * back-button / backdrop-tap dismissal, and the slide-out animation that
//     goes with them.
//
// Callers keep their own `sheetStyle`, so converting a sheet is a matter of
// deleting its Modal/overlay/handle boilerplate, not restyling it.
//
// The two rules disabled below model plain React values, where writing to
// something an effect or a callback captured is a real bug. Reanimated's shared
// values are the opposite: a `.value` write is the entire mechanism, it runs on
// the UI thread, and it deliberately does not go through React. There is no way
// to drive a finger-following drag without one, so the rules are off for this
// file only - every other file in the app keeps them.

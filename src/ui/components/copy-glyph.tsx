// The copy affordance, and the tick that stands in for it after a tap.
//
// Both glyphs are stacked in one fixed square and cross-faded rather than
// swapped by name: at 14-18pt a swap between two frames reads as a flicker, and
// this is the only feedback a copy gives. The square is sized from the glyph so
// nothing in the row moves.
//
// Reanimated defaults to ReduceMotion.System, so the crossfade becomes an
// instant swap on its own when the OS setting is on.
//
// The state half lives in ui/hooks/use-copy.ts.

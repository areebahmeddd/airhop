              a screen reader was stepping through four unlabelled compass
              letters and three ring names before reaching a peer. The canvas is
              therefore hidden as a whole and the individual peers and the centre
              button opt back in below, which leaves a screen reader with

              the guide rings, and every peer, whose x is `C + cos(angle) * r`.

              mirror. Pinning the direction here says that once, in the one place
              the geometry is decided, rather than asking every `left` inside to

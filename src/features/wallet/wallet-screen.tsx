// Wallet screen: Cashu ecash balance, mints, transfers and history.
//
// Every operation goes through `services/wallet-service`, which owns proof
// selection, reservations and mint calls. This file is presentation: it decides
// what to ask, what to show, and how to describe what happened. It deliberately
// does no proof arithmetic of its own, because the same logic also runs from
// the DM thread and the peer sheet and the three must not drift.
//
// Three ideas drive the layout:
//
//   * Money that is not fully yours yet is shown as such. Proofs received over
//     the mesh are real value, but the mint has not confirmed they are unspent,
//     so they get an "unconfirmed" line rather than being folded silently into
//     the headline number.
//   * A send in flight is a first-class object. Building a token reserves the
//     proofs; until the user says it landed, the token stays here to re-share
//     or reclaim. Closing a sheet can no longer destroy value.
//   * Anything that needs the internet says so before it is tapped, and says
//     why when it cannot run (offline, Tor, or a mint that lacks the NUT).

    // pins a multiline TextInput to that many lines and then scrolls the
    // overflow to the cursor, which sits at the end of a programmatic value.

    // part that says what the thing even is, scrolled out of sight above, and
    // left a row of half-glyphs along the top edge that reads as a rendering
    // fault. Text lays out from the top and never scrolls, so the head is
    // always what you see and the ellipsis reads as deliberate. Copy stays the
    // way to get the whole string; nobody transcribes 300 characters by eye.

A Nostr key and a separate identity for each location cell you use are derived from that signing key rather than stored separately. One-time prekeys, which let someone leave you a protected message while you are away, are random keys kept in the same secure storage. Your public keys are shared with peers you communicate with. **Private keys never leave your device**, except when you move Airhop to a new phone of your own, which sends them directly between the two phones over your local network, encrypted, after your phone confirms it is you.",
          "**Display name and preferences.** Your generated display name and app settings are stored locally.",
          "**Message history.** Conversations are stored locally on your device and are never sent to us. They are protected by the operating system's app sandbox and whole-device encryption, not by a separate app-level cipher, so a person with access to an unlocked device can read them. Delete a conversation at any time, or wipe everything instantly with panic wipe.",
          "**Private group state.** Group names, member lists, and the current group key are stored locally so you can keep reading the group. They are removed by panic wipe or by removing the app.",
          "**Bulletin board notices.** Signed public notices, and the deletion markers that retract them, persist until the author's chosen expiry, at most seven days. These are public to the mesh or area they were posted to, not private messages.",
          "**Media attachments.** Photos, videos, voice notes, and files you send or receive are written to the app's cache so they stay viewable. They are deleted automatically once they pass the retention window set in General (seven days by default), and also by panic wipe, by clearing the cache in settings, or by removing the app.",

The same file holds the mints you added, their public keys, and your transaction history (amounts, timestamps, and the mint involved). If a recovery phrase is set up, the twelve words live in secure storage alongside your identity keys, never in the wallet file. **No payment backend is involved and none of this is transmitted to us.**",

In a direct message it stays inside that peer's encrypted session. Nothing is recorded on either device.",
          "A screenshot notice, in private conversations only. Taking a screenshot in a direct message, private group, or private channel tells the people in it that you did, under your display name. In the public mesh room and location channels nothing is sent, because announcing it there would record that you were present. The screenshot itself is never sent.",

      "**Attachments are a partial exception: a photo, video, voice note, or file posted to the public Bluetooth room is signed but not encrypted.** That is the format bitchat reads, and matching it is what lets the two apps exchange media at all. Because attachments relay hop by hop, any device carrying a room attachment can read it, so treat one as visible to the mesh rather than private. A direct attachment is always sealed inside that person's encrypted session, so no relay can read it. It is never sent in readable form: if the other app cannot open a sealed attachment, the send is refused and you are told why.",
      "Nearby mesh devices are not limited to Airhop. [bitchat](https://bitchat.free) is a separate, compatible app that can join the same mesh and receive this same data. bitchat is an independent project with its own codebase, not operated or audited by us.",

      "Airhop can carry the mesh over a WiFi network you are already joined to, which is the only way an iPhone and an Android phone reach each other without Bluetooth. Finding other devices uses mDNS, the same mechanism a printer uses to appear on a network.",
      "**An mDNS announcement is readable by every device on that network, and by whoever runs it.** Network equipment commonly logs it, so on a workplace, campus, hotel or venue network this can tell the operator that a device there is running Airhop, with a timestamp. Bluetooth reaches only as far as the radio does and is not recorded by infrastructure.",
      "What the announcement contains is deliberately empty of history: **a random name, generated fresh each time the transport starts.** It is never your peer ID or any other lasting identifier, so records from two different networks cannot be matched to show the same phone was on both. Your identity is proven only after a connection is made, inside the same encryption every other transport uses.",
      "Message contents are unaffected: they stay end-to-end encrypted exactly as over Bluetooth. What the network operator can observe is that connections exist, when, and roughly how much data moves, in the way any network operator can. Local network is off by default and stays off until you turn it on.",

          "A cell still reveals an approximate area to peers and relays. A finer cell reveals a smaller area.",
          "Each cell uses a separate identity derived on your device, so your activity in one area cannot be linked to another, or to your main identity.",

          "**What a mint cannot see.** Who you are, who you paid, or which coins you deposited became which coins you spent. Cashu signs tokens blindly, so that link is severed by the maths rather than by policy.",
          "**Tor.** On Android, Tor covers mint traffic along with everything else. On iOS, Tor only wraps Nostr connections, so **mint requests are blocked while Tor is on** unless you opt in beside the Tor switch in Settings. Mesh payments are unaffected either way.",
          "**Nutzaps are public.** A NIP-61 nutzap is an unencrypted Nostr event. The ecash is locked to the recipient so nobody else can spend it, but relays and observers can see that one public key paid another, and the amount. The encrypted-message fallback does not have this property.",
          "**Recovery phrase.** Created automatically when the wallet is first set up, so coins can be recovered from the start. It is stored only in your device's secure storage, is never transmitted, is never shown to a mint, and is displayed only after Face ID, a fingerprint or your passcode confirms it is you. Anyone who obtains it can spend your balance.",

With Tor on, **relay operators cannot see your IP address.** Coverage differs by platform: on Android, Tor covers every connection the app makes. On iOS, it covers only the Nostr connections. Tor is off by default.",
      "Tor hides your address from the relay, but not the fact that you are using Tor. On a direct connection the first hop goes to a publicly listed relay, so whoever runs your network can see Tor in use, and may block it. Bridges close that. A bridge is an unlisted entry point, and obfs4 or Snowflake sits in front of it so the connection looks like random noise or ordinary web traffic rather than Tor. Both are built into the app, and bridges are off by default.",
      "A bridge replaces the public relay your connection would normally start from, so it sees your address instead of that relay. Snowflake adds a volunteer's browser in front of the bridge, which sees the same. Neither can read what you send. **This project operates no bridge and no volunteer proxy**, and the built-in bridge addresses come from the Tor Project.",

It only ever touches public #bluetooth traffic, never your private messages, and every bridged message stays signed by its original author, so the bridge cannot read private content or alter what it carries. A per-message "nearby only" control keeps any single message off the internet. Enabling it uses your own data connection and battery. Mesh bridge is off by default.',

// Permissions sub-screen: what the OS has granted this app, in one list.
//
// Two things are deliberately NOT true here, because pretending otherwise is
// how a permissions screen becomes a lie:
//
//   * Nothing on this screen can revoke a permission. No mobile OS lets an app
//     hand one back (Android 13+ has revokeSelfPermissionOnKill, but it kills
//     the process to do it, and iOS has no equivalent at all). So switching a
//     granted row off opens system settings, where revoking actually happens,
//     and the switch stays on until the OS says otherwise.
//   * The state is whatever the OS says right now, re-read every time this
//     screen comes forward. A permission changed in system settings takes
//     effect the moment the user comes back, which is the case a cached copy
//     gets wrong.
//
// What each row can do is ask, when the OS is still willing to be asked. Once
// it is not, the only honest action left is to open Settings.

// Support sub-screen. Two links, both of which leave the app.
//
// Neither goes straight to a checkout, and that is the point. App Store Review
// Guideline 3.1.1 treats an in-app path to a payment sheet as a purchase that
// has to go through in-app purchase, and the carve-outs (registered nonprofits,
// person-to-person gifts) do not cover supporting an individual developer. An
// app that opens a hosted checkout from a "Support" row is the exact shape that
// gets rejected. Sending people to the website instead is what every project in
// this position does, it is explicitly permitted, and it costs one tap.
//
// The card option therefore points at the Support section of the site, which
// carries the same two choices - Dodo Payments for cards, UPI, netbanking and
// wallets, and GitHub Sponsors - and owns the checkout itself. GitHub Sponsors
// stays a direct link because it is a third-party page the user already has an
// account relationship with, not a checkout this app is presenting.
//
// Kept identical on both platforms deliberately. A payment path that differs by
// OS is two flows to reason about and two to keep compliant, for no benefit to
// anyone using it.

// Local Cashu wallet state: proofs, mints, in-flight sends, and history.
//
// Cashu proofs are bearer instruments. Whoever holds the `secret`/`C` pair owns
// the value, so this store is the only place in the app that must be encrypted
// at rest: the backing MMKV file is opened with an AES-256 key that lives in the
// iOS Keychain / Android Keystore (see `bootstrapWalletStorage`). Nothing here
// touches the network; every mint call lives in `src/services/wallet-service.ts`.
//
// Shape
// State is keyed by *account*, meaning a (mint URL, unit) pair. A mint can issue
// sat, usd and eur from the same host, and those are different currencies: they
// must never be summed into one balance. `accountKey()` builds the composite key
// and `parseAccountKey()` splits it back (mint URLs cannot contain `|`).
//
// Proof lifecycle
//   spendable + verified    swapped at the mint, or minted by us. Known good.
//   spendable + unverified  received offline (BLE/QR/paste). Cryptographically
//                           well-formed, and DLEQ-checked when we hold the mint
//                           keys, but the mint has NOT confirmed it is unspent.
//                           DLEQ proves the mint signed it; it can never prove
//                           the sender did not already spend it elsewhere. These
//                           count towards the balance but are surfaced
//                           separately in the UI and are redeemed first.
//   reserved                set aside for a send that has been serialised into a
//                           token but not yet confirmed delivered. Excluded from
//                           the spendable balance so the same proof cannot be
//                           handed to two people, and recoverable via
//                           `reclaimSend` if the transfer never lands.
//
// The reserved bucket is what makes a crash mid-send survivable: proofs are
// moved (never deleted) and the exact token string is kept on the transaction,
// so the user can re-share or reclaim it after a restart.
//
// Backup
// Proof secrets are derived from a twelve-word phrase (NUT-13) rather than
// generated randomly, which is what lets a new device rebuild the balance by
// asking the mint which of those secrets it signed (NUT-09). The phrase is
// generated with the wallet, so this holds from the first proof onwards, and
// `backupEnabled` is the separate question of whether the user has seen and
// accepted the words. `counters` is the per-keyset derivation cursor that makes
// that ordering reproducible; it must only ever move forward, because reusing a
// counter recreates a secret the mint has already seen. `StoredProof.derived`
// records which proofs are actually covered, since anything received from
// somebody else carries their secrets until it is swapped.
//
// The phrase itself is never stored here. It lives in the keychain alongside
// the identity keys (see `core/payments/wallet-seed.ts`).

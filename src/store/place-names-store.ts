// Human-readable names for geohash cells, e.g. "tdr1k" -> "Kumaraswamy Layout".

// A location channel is scoped by a geohash, which is precise but unreadable. We
// reverse-geocode the cell's centre once (best-effort, device-side) and cache
// the result, so the UI can show "~Kumaraswamy Layout" beside the coverage tag,
// matching how bitchat labels its location channels.
//
// Geocoding is best-effort: it needs a network round-trip and a platform
// geocoder, and either can be unavailable. Every failure resolves to no name and
// the UI simply omits it. A successful lookup is cached (a geohash cell maps to
// the same place forever), so we never geocode the same cell twice. Raw
// coordinates never leave the device: only the cell's centre is geocoded, and it
// is derived from the geohash the app already knows. Even that is not asked for
// while the internet is off or Tor is on (see resolve).

// Reverse geocoding is done by the OS, and both platforms answer in the
// DEVICE's language rather than the app's: iOS CLGeocoder follows the bundle's
// preferred localization, Android's Geocoder the default Locale. So a cell
// resolved in English stays "Kumaraswamy Layout" and one resolved in Hindi comes
// back in Devanagari.
//
// The one surface that does not follow the in-app picker, and a limit of the
// wrapper rather than the platforms: both native APIs take a locale,
// `expo-location` exposes neither. A native shim for a room-header label is not
// worth it, so keying on the language is the fix: a stale spelling cannot
// outlive the setting that produced it.
//
// Keyed on the geohash alone the cache never expires, so changing the phone's
// language leaves every seen channel labelled in the old one permanently. Keying
// on the language makes a change re-resolve, and keeps both spellings for the
// user who switches back and forth.
//
// The language is sampled once per process, so a change made while Airhop is
// running lands on the next launch rather than immediately. That is the cheap
// end of the trade and still strictly better than never.

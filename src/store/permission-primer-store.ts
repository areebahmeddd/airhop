// Backing store for the one-time permission primer.
//
// The primer is the screen that explains why a chat app is about to ask for
// Bluetooth and Location, shown once, immediately before the OS dialog.
//
// It has to be awaitable, which is the only reason this is a store rather than
// a prop: the thing that needs to wait is startMeshWithPermissions(), a
// module-level async function with no access to React state. So it follows the
// same shape as alert-store: transient state here, a component reading it, and
// a plain function callers can await.
//
// Deliberately NOT a gate. It resolves whether the user reads it or not, it is
// shown at most once per install (see settings-store.permissionPrimerSeen), and
// nothing downstream branches on what they chose. Its only job is to make the
// OS prompt make sense, because a denial there is expensive: two refusals on
// Android and the permission is blocked for good, leaving the Settings
// deep-link as the only way back.

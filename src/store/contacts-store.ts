// A contact is a *known* identity; a peer is a *reachable* one. They are
// deliberately separate: someone can be a contact while out of range for days,
// and appearing on the Mesh tab should keep meaning "actually nearby right now".

// Storing the public keys is what makes adding a contact meaningful: it lets a
// DM route be established without waiting to hear their ANNOUNCE, gives the
// thread their real nickname instead of one generated from the peer ID, and
// pins the identity so a later ANNOUNCE claiming that peer ID with different
// keys can be recognised as an impersonation attempt.

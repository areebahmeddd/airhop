// way Instagram's activity tab or any chat app's notification history does. It
// spans both DMs and channels because a notification can come from either.
//
// This is a view-side convenience log, not a source of truth: the messages
// themselves live in chat-store. Persisted so the history survives a restart,
// and capped so a busy channel can't grow it without bound.

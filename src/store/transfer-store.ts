// in-flight transfers so the chat UI can show a progress card with percentage,
// speed and ETA.

// Two honesties to keep in mind when reading these numbers:
//   - Send progress reflects bytes handed to the radio, not bytes the far side
//     confirmed. There is no per-fragment acknowledgement, so "sent" is
//     optimistic.
//   - Receive progress reflects chunks that actually arrived and reassembled,
//     so it is exact.
//
// Not persisted: a transfer that did not finish before the app closed is gone,
// there is no resume.

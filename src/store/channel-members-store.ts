// Who has proven they are in a private channel.

// A private channel has no roster on the wire: the key rides an invite link and

// roster lives in group-store). Membership is possession of the key, and the
// only proof of it is a message that opened with it.
//
// Written from both transports, since a private channel can be BLE-only or
// BLE + Nostr:
//   BLE    mesh-service onChannelEnc, when the trial decrypt succeeds
//   Nostr  private-channel-service, when the sealed event opens
//
// Not persisted: this is who is here, not who was ever invited.

// Why an incoming attachment was refused, and whether to say so.
//
// The receive path drops a bad attachment in four places, all of them silently.
// From the outside that is indistinguishable from the file never being sent: the
// sender's bubble says "sent", the recipient sees nothing, and telling the two
// apart means reading the decoder.
//
// Two rules decide whether a refusal becomes a visible line:
//
//   - Direct messages only. A DM has one counterparty who deliberately sent
//     something, so "that didn't arrive" is actionable. Anyone in radio range
//     can put a malformed packet on the air, so a line per bad packet in a
//     public room is a spam vector. Same boundary bitchat draws.
//   - One line per sender per minute. A directed packet is also something
//     anyone in range can send repeatedly. A real failure repeats on retry, and
//     one line conveys that as well as twenty.

// @-mentions: detecting them in message text, and driving the composer's inline

// Mentions are by nickname (the display name), the only stable human-readable
// identifier the mesh exposes. Matching is case-insensitive and token-bounded,
// so "@ana" does not match a message addressed to "@anabelle".
//
// Both sides are normalized before comparison. Announced nicknames are already
// canonical (announce-manager normalizes at decode), but message text is not:
// it is whatever the sender's keyboard produced, and an iOS keyboard and an
// Android one can emit the same accented name in different encodings. Comparing
// raw strings meant a cross-platform mention silently never fired.

// Drives two things from services/notification-pipeline: a mention is the only

//
// The closing boundary is every script's punctuation, not ASCII's: Japanese
// writes "。", Arabic "،", Hindi "।", Burmese "။". Inverting `\p{L}\p{N}_`
// covers all of them and still refuses a prefix, since the character after
// "@ana" in "@anabelle" is a letter.
//
// The opening boundary stays whitespace-or-start. Relaxing it would read
// "ali@example.com" as a mention of "example", and nothing separates that from a
// mention typed mid-sentence. The cost is that Chinese and Japanese need the
// mention at a word start; Slack and Discord draw the same line.

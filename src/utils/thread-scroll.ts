// What a message list should do when its content size changes.
//
// The whole scroll policy, of which this function is the larger half:
//
//   the view follows        anything live, and anything the reader sends
//   the view does not       anything a peer sends, and anything being composed
//
// Live means audio playing right now, in either direction: keying up, and a
// peer taking the floor. Both are handled in message-thread by calling
// jumpToLatest directly, because a burst adds no message and so produces no
// content-size change for this function to see. Everything else arrives here.
//
// A peer's message never moves the reader. The jump-to-latest pill offers the
// trip with a count of what has arrived, and the choice stays theirs.
//
// A chat list is told "your content is now this tall" for two very different
// reasons, and it cannot tell them apart from the event alone:
//
//   * the list is measuring itself: FlatList reports once per batch it
//     renders, so opening a thread produces a run of these before anything has
//     changed, and an image finishing layout produces another later,
//   * a message actually arrived.
//
// Treating the first kind as the second is what makes a thread appear to scroll
// itself down several times when you reopen it: the same landing, performed
// once per batch, animated. So the decision is made here, from the reader's
// position and whether the message count moved, and it is the same rule for
// every caller.

export interface ThreadScrollInput {
  // The reader has not taken hold of the list yet: no drag, no jump to a

  // message and every measurement is another chance to complete that.

  // words somewhere off screen reads as a failed send. Every chat app answers a
  // send the same way, and it is the only exception to the rule below.

  // Scrolling up is a deliberate act: reading back, quoting something, looking

// later batches render, so "open at the newest message" is a run of scrolls, and
// losing the last one leaves the reader a row short of the end. Nothing else
// measures that, and the jump-to-latest pill is suppressed for the whole
// landing, so a near miss would strand them with no way back.
//
// So once the content holds still, check the placement rather than assume it,
// then hand the list back to the reader.

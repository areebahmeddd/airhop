// to notice, and it is the shape of every permanent disappearance - a peer who
// uninstalled, lost their phone, or panic-wiped and came back as a new identity
// (which is unlinkable by design, so no app can ever say which).
//
// Two rules keep this honest.
//
// It is INFORMATIONAL, never a status. Marking these failed would be wrong:
// gift wraps sit on relays and the inbox asks for them with no lower time bound,
// so a peer who returns after three weeks genuinely does receive everything. The
// message is not lost; it is unconfirmed, and those are different claims.
//
// It keys on DELIVERY, never on replies. Someone reading and choosing not to
// answer is a normal conversation, and nagging about it would be the app
// commenting on a relationship. What is worth saying is that nothing has
// reached them.

// When a conversation is worth telling the user has gone unconfirmed.
//
// A peer who panic-wiped is, by design, unlinkable to whoever they come back
// as, so from the other side they are gone for good while every message keeps
// publishing to relays that accept it, and the bubble reads "sent" forever. An
// uninstall, a lost phone and a permanent silence look the same, so one honest
// rule covers them all.
//
// What must NOT happen is calling it failure. Gift wraps sit on relays and the
// inbox asks for them with no lower time bound, so a peer returning after three
// weeks really does receive everything.

// Bound a promise that has no business taking forever.
//
// An unbounded await on the launch path is a way for the app to never open. Two
// that must always be bounded:
//
//   * `readSecret` for the identity, which gates the whole first render. A
//     Keystore that stalls leaves a bare background-colored screen with no
//     text, no spinner and no way out, which looks exactly like a hung splash.
//   * `PermissionsAndroid.requestMultiple`, whose promise is tied to the
//     permission dialog's activity. The dialog runs in another process, and an
//     Activity destroyed or recreated while it is up orphans the promise. Held
//     behind that await, the mesh never starts: a phone that never scans and a
//     Mesh tab stuck on "starting" for the session.
//
// Neither of those is a state the app can detect from the inside, because a
// promise that will never settle is indistinguishable from one that is about to.
// The only defense is a deadline.
//
// A timeout is NOT an error here. Every caller has a defensible answer for "we
// do not know yet" (re-onboard, ask again later, let the reconciler read the
// device itself), so this resolves with a fallback rather than rejecting, and
// the caller stays linear. A late-arriving real answer is ignored: whatever the
// fallback set in motion has already happened, and applying a stale result on
// top of it is how you get two identities or two prompts.

// Resolve with `fallback` if `promise` has not settled within `ms`.
//
// A rejection is still a rejection: this only covers a promise that never
// answers, and swallowing genuine failures would hide the bugs that produce
// them. Callers that also want rejections handled put a `.catch` on the promise
// they hand in.
export function withTimeout<T>(
  promise: Promise<T>,
  ms: number,
  fallback: T,

  return new Promise<T>((resolve, reject) => {
    let settled = false;
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {

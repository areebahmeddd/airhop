// Single source of truth for how a peer is named in the UI.
//
// Three names can exist for one peer and they were being resolved
// inconsistently: peer-list, radar-view and dm-list all called
// peerIDToUsername() directly, so a peer who had set a nickname, or whom the
// user had deliberately added as a contact, still showed as the generated
// "swift-otter-42". Meanwhile channel-info-sheet did consult the announced
// nickname, so the SAME peer appeared under two different names on two screens.
//
// Precedence, most trusted first:
//   1. Local nickname: a name the user typed for a contact they verified in
//      person. Theirs to choose, so it outranks anything the peer asserts.
//   2. Contact nickname: what the peer called themselves on the card that was
//      scanned.
//   3. Announced nickname: what the peer calls themselves over the mesh.
//   4. Generated username: deterministic from the peer ID; always available.
//
// The first two both come back from `nicknameFor`, which prefers the local one.
// `resolvePeerOwnName` below skips it, for the one place that has to show who
// the peer says they are rather than what the user has filed them under.
//
// A Nostr-only correspondent (`nostr_<pubkey>`) has no peer ID to derive from,
// so it gets a short npub-style label instead of a nonsense generated name.

// Where media (photos, videos, files, voice notes) may be sent.
//
// Media rides the BLE file-transfer path only: it is flood-broadcast over
// Bluetooth, never bridged to Nostr, and is signed but not encrypted. So it is
// offered only where that is coherent:
//   - `#bluetooth`, the public Bluetooth-mesh channel (public anyway, and
//     everyone there is reachable over BLE).
//   - Direct mesh DMs (`dm:<peerID>`), which travel over BLE to that peer.
//
// It is OFF everywhere else:
//   - Location channels and teleported `geohash:<gh>` cells are Nostr-scoped;
//     media can't ride Nostr, so remote participants would never receive it.
//   - Private `#name` channels and `group:<id>` groups encrypt their text, so
//     broadcasting unencrypted media would quietly break that privacy.
//   - Geohash DMs (`dm:nostr_<pubkey>`) are Nostr-only pseudonym chats.
//
// This mirrors bitchat's `canSendMediaInCurrentContext` (media only in `.mesh`
// and mesh peer DMs), so the two apps behave the same about what a channel can
// carry.

// mesh service and the chat screens need it and neither may import the other
// (mesh-service already imports file-transfer-service). It decides where an
// untagged broadcast attachment lands, whether media and live voice are
// allowed, and which room shows the bridge toggle.
//
// The name itself is owned by the CHANNEL_MSG codec, which needs it to decide
// whether a payload is bitchat's bare UTF-8 or an Airhop frame. Two spellings
// of the same room would put that decision out of step with the routing, so
// there is one constant and this is a view onto it.

//
// No in the public mesh room or a location cell. There the notice is a plaintext
// broadcast to every radio in range, and on a location channel it is also
// published to Nostr relays as a signed event, permanently recording that this

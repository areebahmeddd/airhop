// grapheme, two UTF-16 units, four UTF-8 bytes. So `maxLength={255}` over a
// 255-BYTE envelope admits 255 emoji, four times too large, which then fails to
// encode with nothing shown to either side.

// Truncation drops whole code points rather than slicing, since a raw `.slice()`
// can split a surrogate pair and emit a lone half that decodes to a replacement
// character. Same rule as `fitNickname` in announce-manager.ts, which fits the
// 32-byte nickname TLV.

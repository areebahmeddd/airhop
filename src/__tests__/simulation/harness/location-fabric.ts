// This exists because its absence quietly disabled two whole features. Every
// simulation file mocked `expo-location` as `{}`, so `getCoarseLocation()`
// returned null, so the named location channels (#block through #region)
// resolved to no geohash cell at all. geohash-channel-service says so plainly:
// "with location denied, the NAMED channels resolve to no cell". No cell means
// nothing is published to Nostr, which means a gateway has nothing to uplink
// and a bridge has no rendezvous cell to meet in.
//
// Scenarios written against that mock could only ever assert that nothing
// happened. Placing the phones somewhere is what makes the internet gateway and
// the mesh bridge testable at all.
//
// Coordinates are per phone, so two devices can share a cell (neighbours) or
// sit in different ones (different cities), which is the distinction both
// features are built around.

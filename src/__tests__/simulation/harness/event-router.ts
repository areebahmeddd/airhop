// One event emitter per phone, enforced rather than hoped for.
//
// THE PROBLEM
//
// `mesh-service.ts` subscribes to native events through React Native's global
// `DeviceEventEmitter`, and the native modules emit through the same one. That
// is correct for an app, where there is one phone. For a simulation it means
// every phone must have its own emitter, or each one receives every other one's
// native events.
//
// The obvious answer, `jest.isolateModules`, does not deliver it. Stores,
// mesh-service and the native harness modules ARE isolated per sandbox, but
// `react-native` is not: it is pinned by the jest-expo preset before any test
// code runs, and survives `jest.resetModules()`. Worse, Babel compiles
// `DeviceEventEmitter.addListener(...)` into a property read on the react-native
// namespace at CALL time, so even swapping the emitter between sandbox builds
// does not help: by the time any phone actually subscribes, every phone reads
// whatever was installed last.
//
// The symptom is silent and total. Every phone registers links it is not party
// to, and every phone receives every packet delivered to anyone, so a four-hop
// relay chain "succeeds" with nothing having relayed anything. The suite goes
// green while testing nothing.
//
// THE FIX
//
// Install one router in place of the shared emitter and give it an explicit
// notion of which phone is currently executing. Subscriptions are filed under
// that phone; emissions are delivered only to it. There is no ambiguity to
// resolve at call time because the harness always knows whose code it is
// running: `DeviceOS.runOnThread` wraps every native-to-JS callback, and
// `SimDevice.launch` wraps subscription.
//
// smoke.test.ts asserts this holds. If that test goes red, nothing else in this
// directory means anything.

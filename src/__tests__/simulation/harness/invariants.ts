// This file is the reason the chaos tiers are worth running. For two phones and
// a scripted exchange you can write down the expected outcome. For twenty
// phones, a flapping radio and a lossy relay set you cannot: the number
// of legal outcomes is enormous, and enumerating them would mean encoding the
// implementation's behaviour as the expectation, which tests nothing.
//
// So the assertions here are properties, not outcomes. "Everyone who could hear
// it ended up with the same messages" is true of a correct system under every
// interleaving and false under none of them. A property that survives a
// thousand random schedules is evidence; a scripted expectation that passes
// once is not.
//
// Each check returns findings rather than throwing, so one scenario reports
// every way it went wrong instead of only the first.

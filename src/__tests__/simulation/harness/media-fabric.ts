// Media: a filesystem, a microphone and a speaker, per phone.
//
// Attachments and live voice are the two features whose bugs only appear when
// something else is happening at the same time, so they cannot be tested with a
// stub that always succeeds. What is needed instead is media that behaves like
// media: files that are actually written and can actually be read back, bytes
// whose magic numbers match their declared MIME (because the receiver checks,
// and a file that lies is dropped), and a microphone that produces frames on a
// clock rather than all at once.
//
// Everything here is per-sandbox. `jest.mock` factories re-run inside each
// isolated module registry, so a module-scope store in this file is one phone's
// storage, exactly as the MMKV mock already works. Two phones cannot see each
// other's files, which is the whole point.

// A bitchat phone, standing in the same room as the Airhop ones.
//
// VISION.md puts wire compatibility among the non-negotiables, and PROGRESS.md
// is honest that it has never been proven anywhere but on paper. A compat test
// that only checks Airhop against ITSELF cannot find a divergence, because both
// sides share the bug. So this node is written to bitchat's rules rather than
// to Airhop's, and its whole job is to disagree when Airhop is wrong:
//
//   * It interprets only the packet types bitchat defines. Airhop's own
//     extensions - DR_ENCRYPTED (0x12), CHANNEL_ENC (0x50), CHANNEL_MSG_AIRHOP
//     (0x51) - reach no handler, while still being RELAYED like any other
//     packet (BLEService's type switch logs `case .none` and falls through to
//     scheduleRelayIfNeeded). Both halves matter: Airhop's extras must cost
//     bitchat nothing AND must still cross a mesh made of bitchat phones.
//   * It refuses a courier envelope whose expiry is beyond 24h + 1h slack,
//     which is what bitchat's CourierStore does and what silently ate every
//     Airhop envelope before that constant was corrected.
//   * It verifies signatures before displaying or relaying, and relays with the
//     TTL decrement and dedup any bitchat node performs.
//
// It deliberately does NOT reuse Airhop's mesh-service. It does reuse
// packet-codec, because that file IS the claim under test: if Airhop's encoder
// and bitchat's decoder disagree, the byte layout is wrong, and the layout is
// the thing both projects have agreed on.

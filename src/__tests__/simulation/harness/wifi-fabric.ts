// The same-platform fast path, as a fabric.
//
// Both platforms run WiFi Aware, the same NAN protocol, behind one TypeScript
// interface. Airhop treats it as one optional transport that beats BLE when it
// exists, which is the whole reason it is worth simulating: the mesh engine is
// supposed to not care which radio carried a packet.
//
// Deliberately far simpler than RadioFabric. A BLE link is the interesting one
// to model badly-behaved: it has an MTU ceiling, RSSI, loss and jitter, and the
// app's correctness depends on coping with all of it. A WiFi link is a socket:
// it is either up or it is not, it carries a whole frame, and it is orders of
// magnitude faster. Modelling loss and MTU here would be inventing failure modes
// the transport does not have.
//
// Two rules it DOES model, because both are real constraints and both are easy
// things to get wrong:
//
//   1. An Android phone and an iPhone never form a WiFi link, however close they
//      stand. Both speak NAN, but Apple requires a paired device for every data
//      path and refuses an open one, and Android cannot complete Apple's
//      pairing. Same protocol, still not a cross-platform path.
//   2. Two iPhones only link once they are paired. Pairing is the whole shape of
//      Apple's API, so a scenario that forgets it is asserting something the
//      field will never do. Android has no such gate and needs none.

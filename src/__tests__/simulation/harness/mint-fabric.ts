// A Cashu mint that exists only in this process.
//
// The seam is `globalThis.fetch`, which is what @cashu/cashu-ts uses for every
// call. Everything above the wire therefore runs for real: real blinding, real
// unblinding, real proof selection, real fee arithmetic, real DLEQ
// verification. The mint does real BDHKE too - it is only forty lines of
// secp256k1 - because a mint that returned made-up signatures would make every
// DLEQ check pass or fail for the wrong reason, and DLEQ is precisely what
// stands between a user and a forged token.
//
// What this buys that a stubbed wallet cannot:
//
//   * Double-spend is REAL. The mint keeps a spent set, and the second person
//     to present a proof is refused by the same code path a real mint uses.
//   * Value conservation is checkable. Everything the mint ever signed is
//     known (`totalIssued`) and so is everything it kept in fees
//     (`feesCollected`), so "no sat was created or destroyed" is an arithmetic
//     fact rather than an assumption. Both terms are needed once a mint charges:
//     a swap reissues LESS than it takes, and the difference is not lost, it is
//     the mint's.
//   * Failure is injectable at the transport, so "the mint went away mid-swap"
//     is the same event the app would see in a tunnel.

// bitchat compatibility, tested against bitchat rather than against ourselves.
//
// VISION.md principle 6 says Airhop nodes must talk to bitchat nodes, and
// principle 7 says that when in doubt we do what bitchat does.
// packet-frame-vectors.test.ts already pins byte offsets, but against Airhop's
// own constants,
// which cannot catch a divergence both sides of the assertion share.
//
// Two things here go further:
//
//   1. A live mixed mesh. A BitchatActor implements bitchat's rules - its own
//      type registry, its own signature policy, its own courier ceiling - and
//      stands in the same room as real Airhop phones. Messages have to cross in
//      both directions, and Airhop's private extensions have to cost it
//      nothing.
//   2. A differential read of the ACTUAL bitchat sources, which are vendored in
//      this repo. Constants are parsed out of the Swift and compared to
//      Airhop's, so an upstream change shows up as a failing test rather than
//      as a field report.

// The same-platform fast path.
//
// ARCHITECTURE.md lists WiFi Aware as an accelerator that the mesh engine is
// not supposed to notice: same `Transport` interface as BLE, priority 1 in the
// router, and it carries what BLE cannot. These scenarios form real links over
// harness/wifi-fabric.ts rather than taking that on trust.
//
// What is worth asserting, and why:
//
//   * A link forms and the phones find each other over it, with no BLE at all.
//     If discovery only ever worked because a radio fabric was also running,
//     the fast path would be decorative.
//   * Messages cross it, and the timeline cannot tell which radio carried them.
//     That is the claim the whole two-transport design rests on.
//   * Android and iOS never link. Two different protocols behind one interface
//     is exactly the shape that invites a wrong assumption.
//   * Losing the link is cleaned up, so a peer that walked away does not sit in
//     the registry looking reachable.
//   * A payload far past the BLE frame ceiling crosses in one piece. This is the
//     entire reason the transport exists.

// disabling any one of them changes nothing observable.

// For a DM that is doubly unfalsifiable: even with both dedup layers removed,
// a Double Ratchet message can only be decrypted once, so a second copy can
// never reach the thread. Such a test could not fail, so it would test

// own WiFi bulk path and later found it had never fired once in production: an
// unrelated image-compression change put every real photo below the size that
// triggers the transport, so the feature was live, tested, and dead. A radio
// that only carries traffic in a configuration nobody is in is decorative, and
// nothing about the app's behaviour would say so.
//
// Airhop has no size threshold, so it cannot fail that exact way. What it has
// instead is the direct-link shortcut: an addressed packet goes to the WiFi
// link when the recipient has been mapped to one, which is the whole reason the
// mapping exists (ARCHITECTURE.md, "Transport Stack"). If that mapping never
// populates in practice, or the BLE path wins the race, every attachment
// quietly fragments over Bluetooth at ~18 KiB/s while a 250 Mbps radio sits idle
// beside it. The symptom is "photos are slow", which is indistinguishable from
// the way they have always been.

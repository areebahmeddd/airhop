// The internet gateway and the mesh bridge, tested for real.
//
// Both features were previously "covered" by scenarios that could not fail: one
// never sent a message, and the other's key assertion passed when nothing
// crossed. The cause was the harness, not the app - every simulation file
// mocked `expo-location` as `{}`, so the named location channels resolved to no
// geohash cell, so there was nothing to uplink and nowhere to meet. With phones
// actually placed somewhere (harness/location-fabric.ts) both features come
// alive and can be held to account.
//
// The distinction that matters throughout: a phone with no internet is NOT a
// phone with the internet switched off. Turning it off in settings tears down
// the Nostr transport entirely, and with it the geohash service that asks a
// gateway for help. The real user is someone whose relays are simply
// unreachable - no signal, a dead hotel wifi - which is `relay.setOffline`.

// A model of the operating system, not of Airhop.
//
// Lifecycle bugs live in the gap between what the app believes about the
// device and what the device is actually doing. A test that mocks the native
// module away cannot find them, because the mock agrees with the app by
// construction. So this file models the OS side of that gap (the rules Android
// and iOS actually enforce), and the native modules are modelled separately
// (android-native.ts, ios-native.ts) as code running ON this OS.
//
// Everything the OS enforces here is a real, documented behaviour:
//
//   - A runtime permission is granted to the APP before it is enforced by the
//     Bluetooth STACK. PermissionsAndroid resolves on the first; BLE calls are
//     checked against the second. bitchat-android papers over the window with
//     `delay(1000)` and the comment "This solves the issue where app needs
//     restart to work on first install" (MainActivity.kt). Modelled as
//     `permissionSettleMs`.
//   - Turning the adapter off invalidates every GATT handle the app holds. The
//     handles stay non-null and look alive; every call through them fails.
//   - An uncaught exception on any Android thread kills the process. There is no
//     "it threw but carried on": a BroadcastReceiver that throws takes the app
//     with it.
//   - Reaching JS from native is only legal while a React runtime exists.
//     Bridgeless RN throws IllegalStateException otherwise.
//   - startForegroundService() from the background is refused on Android 12+.
//   - CoreBluetooth reports state asynchronously after a manager is constructed,
//     and drops any command issued before it reaches poweredOn.
//
// The trace this records is the deliverable: it shows a scenario wedging and
// which call was swallowed, without a device in hand.

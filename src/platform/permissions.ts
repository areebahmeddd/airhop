// The three states people actually hit are distinct and want distinct

//
//   undetermined  the OS prompt has never been shown. Show it. Saying anything
//                 of the app's own first is a second dialog nobody asked for.
//   deniable      denied once, but the OS will still prompt. Ask again, because
//                 the user is now in the flow that needs it and the ask finally
//                 has context.
//   blocked       denied for good ("Don't allow" twice on Android, any denial on
//                 iOS). Prompting again is a silent no-op, so this is the only
//                 case that deserves a message from the app, and that message
//                 has to include the way out, which is the Settings app.
//
// Callers get a plain boolean and can stay linear.

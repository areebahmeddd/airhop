// Getting the user to the screen where they can stop the OS killing the mesh.
//
// On Android, aggressive battery management from OEM skins (Xiaomi MIUI,
// Samsung One UI, Huawei EMUI, Oppo ColorOS, vivo Funtouch) reaps foreground
// services. That breaks BLE scanning, the foreground service that holds the
// process up, and the Nostr relay socket. The app cannot fix it from code; the
// only fix is the user whitelisting Airhop, and there is no single Android
// screen for that, which is exactly why describing where to tap does not work.
//
// This module answers "where should this device be sent", as an ORDERED list of
// targets to try. The caller walks it and stops at the first one that opens.
//
// A settings ACTION is not a URL and must not be posted as one. React Native's
// `Linking.openURL` builds `Intent(ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url))` and never calls
// `Intent.parseUri` (IntentModule.kt), so an `intent:#Intent;action=...;end`
// string resolves to nothing and throws. `Linking.sendIntent(action)` builds
// `Intent(action)` and pre-resolves it against the package manager, rejecting
// cleanly when nothing handles it. Hence a target that says which of the two it
// is, and a caller that dispatches accordingly.
//
// The two lists below answer different questions. "This brand kills background
// services" is not "this brand exposes a screen to deep-link to": Samsung's
// sleeping-apps screen lives inside com.samsung.android.lool and Huawei's
// protected-apps inside com.huawei.systemmanager, neither reachable by a public
// action. They belong in the first list only, and get the standard
// battery-optimization list, which exists on both and is where the whitelist
// lives.

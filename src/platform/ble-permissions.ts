// Runtime BLE permission gate.
//
// Ungranted, startScanning / startAdvertising throw SecurityException and the
// mesh service swallows it, so the app looks fine and never sees a peer. That
// silence is why this gate is explicit rather than lazy.
//
// What it asks for, per API level:
//   - API 31+ : BLUETOOTH_SCAN, BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE, BLUETOOTH_CONNECT, and no
//     location. neverForLocation on BLUETOOTH_SCAN is accurate (a result is read
//     for service UUID, peer ID and RSSI, none of them a position) and releases
//     scanning from the location permission and the OS toggle both.
//   - API <=30: ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, since neverForLocation does not exist and
//     Android withholds every result without it.
//
// Deliberately unlike bitchat/android, which requires location at every level
// and so also needs ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION and a `location` service type:
// that coupling costs a backgrounded phone every scan result, and anyone on
// "Approximate" a mesh that finds nobody. The advertisement and the wire
// protocol are untouched, so interop is unaffected.
//
// location-service.ts still requests location when a geohash channel opens.
// Denying it costs channels, not the mesh.
//
// iOS needs nothing here: CoreBluetooth prompts on first manager use, backed by
// the NSBluetooth*UsageDescription strings in Info.plist.

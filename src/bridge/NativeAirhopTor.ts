// The native contract for the Arti-based Tor client.
//
// Hand-maintained, not Codegen input. See NativeAirhopBLE.ts for why.
//
// Both platforms, backed by one Rust crate in native/arti: iOS links it as a
// static library behind ios/Airhop/AirhopTorModule.swift, Android loads it as a
// shared object behind AirhopTorModule.kt. The two modules expose this identical
// surface, so nothing above here branches on platform for Tor's lifecycle.
//
// One difference survives, and it is about coverage rather than lifecycle. On
// Android the proxy is installed into React Native's OkHttp clients and as the
// process's default selector, so every web request the Java stack makes is
// covered, `fetch` and downloads included. On iOS only the Nostr
// WebSocket goes through Tor, which is why a mint request there has to be
// refused rather than routed. See services/tor-routing.ts.

  // fresh and guards warm all day on a battery.

  // Dormancy rather than a stop, deliberately. Stopping would drop the guards,
  // cost the user a fresh bootstrap on every return to the app, and make the

// The native contract for the high-bandwidth WiFi transport.
//
// Hand-maintained, not Codegen input. See NativeAirhopBLE.ts for why.
//
// Backed by AirhopWiFiModule.kt (NAN, API 29+) and AirhopWiFiModule.swift
// (WiFiAware, iOS 26+). One contract, two implementations of the same radio
// protocol, and the mesh engine does not know which it has.
//
// Still not a cross-platform path: Apple requires a paired data path and refuses
// an open one, and Android cannot complete Apple's pairing. Android to Android,
// or iPhone to iPhone.
//
// Callers optional-chain, and wifi-controller.ts reads a missing module as
// permanently unsupported.
//
// Events emitted by native code:
//
//   AirhopWiFi.packetReceived      { linkID, dataBase64 }
//   AirhopWiFi.linkConnected       { linkID }
//   AirhopWiFi.linkDisconnected    { linkID }
//   AirhopWiFi.availabilityChanged { available }
//
// availabilityChanged tells the reconciler to forget it is started. It is sent
// when the radio is gone or the attach has to be rebuilt, never for what native
// recovers from on its own (a discovery session ending, a peer not answering, a
// data path dropping), so the links JS holds survive those. Android carries both
// edges off the framework's state broadcast; iOS has no such broadcast and
// reports only the falling edge, which is why the controller answers a drop
// with a retry ladder.

// The native contract for the LAN transport: mDNS discovery over ordinary TCP.
//
// Hand-maintained, not Codegen input. See NativeAirhopBLE.ts for why.
//
// Backed by AirhopLANModule.kt (NsdManager) and AirhopLANModule.swift
// (NWListener / NWBrowser on Network framework). One contract, two
// implementations, and the mesh engine does not know which it has.
//
// This is the only transport that reaches an iPhone and an Android phone over
// something other than Bluetooth. WiFi Aware cannot: Apple demands a paired
// data path Android cannot complete. Being plain IP, this does not care which
// phone anyone owns.
//
// Discovery and dialling are split, unlike AirhopWiFi where native connects to
// whatever it finds. mDNS finds EVERYONE on the network, and connecting to
// everyone is a full mesh whose cost grows with the square of the room. Who to
// dial is therefore a decision, and decisions live in TypeScript: native
// reports what it sees and opens the sockets it is told to. See
// services/lan-controller.ts for the rule.
//
// Callers optional-chain, and lan-controller.ts reads a missing module as
// permanently unsupported.
//
// Events emitted by native code:
//
//   AirhopLAN.peerDiscovered      { serviceName }
//   AirhopLAN.peerLost            { serviceName }
//   AirhopLAN.linkConnected       { linkID }
//   AirhopLAN.linkDisconnected    { linkID }
//   AirhopLAN.packetReceived      { linkID, dataBase64 }
//   AirhopLAN.availabilityChanged { available }
//
// `availabilityChanged` tells the reconciler to forget it is started, the same
// contract AirhopWiFi has. Android carries both edges off the network callback;
// iOS reports the falling edge only, so the controller answers a drop with its
// retry ladder rather than waiting to be told the network came back.

// The native contract for Wi-Fi Aware device pairing.
//
// Hand-maintained, not Codegen input. See NativeAirhopBLE.ts for why.
//
// iOS ONLY, backed by AirhopWiFiPairing.swift. Absent on Android rather than
// stubbed, because Apple's Wi-Fi Aware has no unpaired mode and Android's needs
// no pairing at all. services/wifi-pairing-service.ts optional-chains and reads
// a missing module as "this platform has no pairing gate".
//
// Separate from NativeAirhopWiFi because that spec is the transport, which both
// platforms implement in full. Pairing is a precondition to HAVING links here,
// not a property of a link.
//
// Events emitted by native code:
//
//   AirhopWiFiPairing.devicesChanged { count }
//
// Fires on every change to the paired list, including one made in the Settings
// app, which has no other signal at all.

  // Pairing is two-sided, the way Bluetooth pairing is: `mode` is "find" to
  // browse for a device that has made itself discoverable, or "discoverable" to
  // advertise so the other one can find this.
  //
  // `labels` and `colors` are the screen that launches Apple's sheet, which is
  // ours rather than the system's. Both cross the bridge for the same reason:
  // native owns no user-facing content and no visual value. The strings come
  // from the catalog and the colours from `useThemeColors()`, so the screen
  // follows the app's theme without Swift holding a second palette that would
  // drift from src/ui/theme.ts.
  //
  // Resolves when the screen is dismissed, paired or not: the result arrives
  // through devicesChanged. Rejects with WIFI_AWARE_UNSUPPORTED or NO_PRESENTER.

//
// adapterStateChanged fires on a real change only. Emitting it from every
// CBManager state callback reads as a radio change, which restarts the radios,
// which builds a new manager, which fires another callback.
//
// scanFailed is Android's ScanCallback.onScanFailed: the platform refusing a scan
// after startScan() returned cleanly. It is the one radio failure the reconciler
// cannot observe for itself, since it already believes it is scanning, so without
// the event `actual.scanning` stays true forever and nothing retries. errorCode 6
// is SCAN_FAILED_SCANNING_TOO_FREQUENTLY and needs a longer stand-down than the
// usual backoff ladder.
//
// powerStateChanged is coalesced to meaningful battery movement, charger changes
// and the Battery Saver switch, not the per-1% stream ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED
// delivers. Native applies no policy, only deciding when the number is worth
// reporting.
//
// meshStopRequested is the "Stop mesh" button on the foreground-service
// notification. Native raises it rather than stopping the radios itself, so the
// decision goes through the same presence path as the in-app control and the two
// cannot disagree.

Airhop is an iOS + Android app (macOS and Windows coming soon) for private, offline-first peer-to-peer communication over [Bluetooth mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking) networks, with [Nostr](https://nostr.org) internet bridging and [Cashu](https://cashu.space) [ecash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecash) payments. **Our mission is to make censorship-resistant communication available to anyone: during natural disasters, internet blackouts, mass protests, or any situation where networks are unavailable, surveilled, or shut down.**

I built this at a 24-hour hackathon (July 2026) during my final year of undergrad, on top of the foundation of [bitchat](https://bitchat.free). It uses the same [BLE wire protocol](docs/spec/PROTOCOLS.md) and [service UUIDs](docs/spec/PROTOCOLS.md#1-ble-identifiers), meaning Airhop-installed devices can automatically discover and join the same mesh as nearby bitchat-installed devices, relay messages, and exchange DMs with zero setup. It also extends the protocol with [Double Ratchet](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet) forward secrecy, offline ecash payments, and offline AI (not present in bitchat _at the time_).

> [!NOTE]
> Airhop is an independent side project built and maintained by [Areeb Ahmed](https://github.com/areebahmeddd) in his free time. It is not backed by any company or organization, not affiliated with or endorsed by permissionlesstech or the bitchat project, and not an impersonation of any existing app or service.

> [!WARNING]
> Not externally security-reviewed. All code is personally reviewed and run through the [security review agent](.github/agents/security-review.md) before shipping, but this is not a substitute for a formal audit. Do not rely on its security for sensitive use cases. External audit planned for [v1.9.0](docs/design/ROADMAP.md#v190-security-hardening).

## Transports

Airhop chooses a transport per message. Bluetooth is the only one that needs no internet and no network at all, which is why it is the default. The others are used when they are available, and courier is what runs when none of them are.

|                   | Bluetooth LE mesh                                                  | LAN (mDNS + TCP)                        | WiFi Aware                        | Nostr relays                     | Courier (store-and-forward)              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Carries           | Channel messages, DMs, files, ecash                                | Everything Bluetooth carries            | DMs and files, when a link exists | DMs and geohash channel messages | Sealed text envelopes, up to 16 KiB each |
| Needs internet    | No                                                                 | No, but everyone must be on one network | No                                | Yes                              | No                                       |
| iPhone to Android | Yes                                                                | Yes                                     | No                                | Yes                              | Yes                                      |
| Range             | ~10-30 m indoors, up to ~100 m line of sight, extended by each hop | Wherever the network reaches            | ~30 m                             | Global                           | Wherever the carrier walks               |
| Max hops          | 7                                                                  | 1                                       | 1                                 | 1                                | 1 carrier, but unbounded in time         |
| Speed             | ~18 KiB/s to one peer, ~15 KiB/s to a channel                      | Network speed, with no radio pacing     | ~18 KiB/s, paced like Bluetooth   | Not used for files               | Not used for files                       |
| Latency per hop   | 10-220 ms (randomized to avoid collisions)                         | Network round trip                      | n/a                               | Relay round trip; more over Tor  | Whenever the carrier meets the recipient |

Notes on the numbers:

- Text messages (channel and DM) are tiny and effectively instant on any transport. Throughput only matters for files.
- The ~18 KiB/s figure is 467 bytes per fragment sent one every 25 ms. The delay is required: without it the radio drops fragments and the transfer never completes.
- A channel attachment paces at 30 ms instead (~15 KiB/s), since each broadcast fragment requires one radio write per connected peer, increasing airtime usage as the room grows.
- A 1 MiB file (the per-file cap) takes about 56 seconds to one peer. bitchat rejects anything larger as it decodes the packet, so the cap is not ours to raise and chunking above it was dropped. An Airhop-only path stays possible, but it cannot be the default without losing bitchat compatibility.
- LAN needs no such pacing, since the 25 ms delay is a Bluetooth requirement rather than a protocol one. The 467-byte fragment size stays regardless: the receiver reassembles by index and a peer may be relaying to Bluetooth next.
- Wi-Fi Aware doesn’t work across platforms. Apple requires pairing that Android can’t complete, so connections are limited to Android-to-Android (Android 10+) or iPhone-to-iPhone (iOS 26+, paired once).
- Nostr relays carry small signed events, not file bytes. Files can be shared over Nostr only by uploading them to a separate HTTP host and posting a link ([NIP-96](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/96.md)). Airhop does not do this: that host is a central server that can log, throttle, or take down your files, which is exactly what this app avoids. Attachments therefore travel only over Bluetooth, LAN or WiFi.
- Courier is the fallback when no other transport can reach the recipient. The envelope is sealed to a one-time prekey before it leaves, so the carrier holding it cannot read it, and it is dropped after 24 hours if nobody meets the recipient. Text only: media is never couriered.

Timing intervals:

| Behaviour                  | Interval           | Why                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Presence broadcast         | 4 s alone, 15-30 s | Fast while alone so devices meet quickly, then backs off            |
| Gossip sync                | 15 s               | Lets a peer returning from out of range catch up on missed messages |
| Direct peer timeout        | 45 s               | Handles unreported link drops beyond broadcast                      |
| Mesh peer timeout          | 60 s               | Relayed peers get longer, since multi-hop packets arrive late       |
| Geohash presence heartbeat | 40-80 s            | Randomized so a fixed interval cannot fingerprint the sender        |
| Geohash participant window | 5 min              | Covers several heartbeats, so a missed round does not drop the peer |

## How Airhop Compares

Offline and private messengers generally fall into three categories:

- Internet-only messaging apps that rely on online infrastructure and cannot communicate locally without internet access.
- Radio-based mesh networks that work offline but require dedicated hardware.
- Phone-to-phone mesh apps that use Bluetooth and WiFi on devices people already own.

Airhop belongs to the third category and extends it with a Nostr-based internet layer for long-distance communication when connectivity is available. The table is grouped in that order, starting with the apps most people already measure private messaging against.

⚠️ Threema's client apps are open source, but its servers are not, and the app is a paid one-time purchase.

Signal and Threema are here as the benchmark rather than as alternatives. Both are excellent at what they do, and neither is trying to work without a network: Signal ties an account to a phone number and Threema to a Threema ID, and both stop entirely when the network does. Airhop is aimed at the moment after that, when there is no network to be excellent on.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/areebahmeddd/airhop
cd airhop
npm install
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Never run `npx expo prebuild`. The `ios/` and `android/` directories are checked in and hand-modified, and prebuild overwrites them.

<details>
<summary><strong>Xcode setup</strong></summary>

1. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) from the Mac App Store, which also installs the iOS Simulator and base build tools
2. Open Xcode at least once and let it install any additional required components when prompted
3. Go to **Xcode** then **Settings** then **Locations**, and select the most recent version in the **Command Line Tools** dropdown
4. Go to **Xcode** then **Settings** then **Platforms**, click the **+** icon, and add an **iOS** runtime if one is not already installed
5. Install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) if it is not already present, then run `npx pod-install` from the project root to install the iOS native dependencies.
6. Launch a simulator from the device dropdown, then run `npm run ios`

> The first `npm run ios` builds the native app from scratch and can take several minutes. Later runs are much faster.

> Requires a physical iPhone for BLE mesh testing (the iOS Simulator does not support Bluetooth) and supports iOS 16.0 or later.

> Changing a native dependency also changes `ios/Podfile.lock`, which pins exact pod versions. Regenerate it with `npx pod-install` in the same commit.

If a build fails after changing dependencies, clear the Xcode and CocoaPods caches before trying again:

```bash
rm -rf ios/Pods ios/build ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Airhop-*
npx pod-install
npm run ios
```

<summary><strong>Android Studio setup</strong></summary>

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) from the official site, which also installs the Android SDK and base build tools
2. Open Android Studio at least once and let the setup wizard install any additional required components when prompted
3. Click the gear icon and open **Settings**, then go to **Languages & Frameworks** then **Android SDK**
4. On the **SDK Platforms** tab, tick **API 34**, **API 35**, and **API 36**, then click **Apply** to download them, since a fresh install does not include them
5. On the **SDK Tools** tab, confirm **Android SDK Build-Tools**, **Android SDK Platform-Tools**, and **Android Emulator** are installed
6. Copy the SDK path shown at the top of the **Android SDK** page into an `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable, or into `android/local.properties` as `sdk.dir=<path>`, since Gradle looks there for it
7. Open the virtual device manager: **More Actions** then **Virtual Device Manager** from the Welcome screen, or **View** then **Tool Windows** then **Device Manager** if a project is already open
8. Click **Create Device**, choose a **Pixel 9 Pro** profile, select one of the API levels just installed, then click **Finish**
9. Launch the emulator from the device list, then run `npm run android`

> The first `npm run android` builds the native app from scratch and can take several minutes. Later runs are much faster.

> Requires a physical Android device for BLE mesh testing (the Android Emulator does not support Bluetooth) and supports Android 10.0 (API 29) or later.

> Changing a native dependency also changes `android/app/gradle.lockfile`, which pins exact versions. Regenerate it in the same commit.

If a build fails after changing dependencies, clear the Gradle caches before trying again:

```bash
cd android && ./gradlew --stop
rm -rf ../node_modules/expo-modules-core/expo-module-gradle-plugin/{build,.gradle}
./gradlew app:dependencies --write-locks
./gradlew app:assembleDebug -Pkotlin.incremental=false
cd .. && npm run android
```

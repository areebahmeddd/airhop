                and are never sent to us. They are protected by the operating system's app sandbox
                and whole-device encryption, not by a separate app-level cipher, so a person with
                access to an unlocked device can read them. Delete a conversation at any time, or
                wipe everything instantly with panic wipe.

              Airhop can carry the mesh over a WiFi network you are already joined to, which is the
              only way an iPhone and an Android phone reach each other without Bluetooth. Finding
              other devices uses mDNS, the same mechanism a printer uses to appear on a network.

              Network equipment commonly logs it, so on a workplace, campus, hotel or venue network
              this can tell the operator that a device there is running Airhop, with a timestamp.
              Bluetooth reaches only as far as the radio does and is not recorded by infrastructure.

              What the announcement contains is deliberately empty of history:{" "}
              <strong>a random name, generated fresh each time the transport starts.</strong> It is
              never your peer ID or any other lasting identifier, so records from two different
              networks cannot be matched to show the same phone was on both. Your identity is proven

              A device with the mesh bridge enabled links your area's public #bluetooth channel with
              another Bluetooth crowd out of radio range, carrying that public chat between them
              over the internet. It only ever touches public #bluetooth traffic, never your private
              messages, and every bridged message stays signed by its original author, so the bridge
              cannot read private content or alter what it carries. A per-message "nearby only"
              control keeps any single message off the internet. Enabling it uses your own data
              connection and battery. Mesh bridge is off by default.

              A device with the gateway setting enabled relays location-channel messages on behalf

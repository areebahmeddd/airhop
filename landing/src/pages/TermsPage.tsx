                There is no central server, so we cannot moderate, edit, or delete what you or

              Deleting your own notice broadcasts a signed retraction that other devices honor, and

              Airhop includes an optional Cashu ecash wallet.{" "}
              <strong>
                We do not operate any payment infrastructure. We are not a financial institution,
                payment processor, money services business, or custodian of your funds.
              </strong>{" "}
              We have no ability to reverse, recover, freeze, or mediate any transaction.

              <strong>Mints are third parties you choose.</strong> A mint is an independent server
              that issues and redeems ecash and holds the bitcoin backing it. Airhop ships with no
              default mint and does not endorse, vet, or monitor any of them. Adding a mint means
              trusting that operator with whatever balance you keep there. A mint may go offline,
              refuse service, change its fees, or fail to honor its tokens, and any loss that
              follows is between you and that operator.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-[1.75]">
              <strong>Ecash is a bearer instrument.</strong> Whoever holds a token can spend it. A
              token sent to the wrong person, posted to a public channel, or read by someone over
              your shoulder is gone. Once someone has redeemed a token at its mint, the transfer is
              final and cannot be reversed by anyone.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-[1.75]">
              <strong>Recovery is your responsibility.</strong> The wallet's recovery phrase is the
              only way to rebuild a balance on another device, and writing it down is up to you. It
              is stored on your device and nowhere else. We cannot recover it, reset it, or help you
              if it is lost, and anyone who obtains it can spend your balance.

              <strong>Lightning deposits and withdrawals</strong> are performed by your chosen mint
              and the wider Lightning Network, not by us. Routing fees, failed payments, and
              settlement delays are outside our control.

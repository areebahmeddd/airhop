            Airhop is an open-source iOS and Android app for private, peer-to-peer messaging over
            Bluetooth mesh. There are no central servers. Messages relay automatically across nearby
            devices up to 7 hops. <strong>It works with zero internet connectivity.</strong>

            Most private messengers fall into three groups. Apps like Signal and Session are strong
            on privacy but need the internet, so they go down when the network does. Meshtastic and
            goTenna work offline but only with a separate radio you have to buy and carry. Briar,
            Berty, Bridgefy and <TextLink href="https://bitchat.free">bitchat</TextLink> run phone
            to phone on hardware you already own, and that is where Airhop sits.
            <br />
            <br />
            Against bitchat specifically, Airhop is built on top of it and stays wire-compatible,
            but adds Double Ratchet forward secrecy, Tor on both iOS and Android, offline ecash
            payments, and an offline AI assistant, none of which bitchat has today. Beyond the
            protocol itself, <strong>user experience is everything to us</strong>. Great privacy
            tools should be easy to use, not something people have to figure out.

            Some things are missing because they are still being built, and some because they cannot
            work without breaking something that matters more. The second kind:
            <ul className="my-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
              <li>
                <strong>No voice or video calling.</strong> The fast transports that could carry a
                call are different protocols on iPhone and Android with no bridge between them, so
                it could never work across the two. Holding the mic to talk live is what replaces
                it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Only text crosses the internet.</strong> Photos, files, and voice notes ride
                Bluetooth, so sending one needs the other person in range.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1 MiB per file.</strong> bitchat refuses anything larger the moment it
                decodes the packet, so a bigger file would be dropped outright by half the mesh.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Attachments do not queue.</strong> A text message waits on your phone until
                a route appears. A file has to leave while a link exists, so it fails and offers a
                retry rather than sitting in a queue that may never drain.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No cloud backup.</strong> Nothing is stored off your phone, so losing the
                phone loses the history. That is the trade for having nothing to seize or subpoena.

            There are four kinds of room, and what separates them is who can get in.
            <ul className="my-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
              <li>
                <strong>Public channels:</strong> anyone in Bluetooth range who types the name is in
                it. Nothing is registered anywhere, nobody owns it, and it stays on the local mesh.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Location channels:</strong> public as well, but scoped to a map cell instead
                of a name, from a single block up to a whole region. Your own cell opens
                automatically, and entering a geohash takes you to any other. These bridge over the
                internet, so you can read a place you are not standing in.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Private channels:</strong> invite-only. The key travels inside the invite
                link, so anyone holding the link can read, and there is no member limit. Built for a
                crowd that has to grow faster than anyone could add people by hand.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Private groups:</strong> a fixed roster instead of a link. The creator signs
                a member list of up to 16 and hands the key to each person individually, so nobody
                can forward their way in. Bluetooth only.

        q: "Can I block someone?",
        a: (
          <>
            Yes. Open the direct conversation from your chat list and pick Block contact. Everything
            from that peer is then dropped at a single point before it can reach any chat: channel
            messages, direct messages, files, and anything arriving over Nostr. They also stop
            appearing on your Mesh tab. The block is saved, so it survives restarting the app, and
            you can lift it later under Settings then Security.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Blocking is one-sided and local to your phone</strong>, so it hides them from
            you rather than announcing anything to them. Your device also keeps relaying mesh
            traffic that happens to route through it, theirs included, because refusing would
            degrade the network for everyone else routing through you. None of that relayed traffic
            is ever shown to you.

        q: "Can people tell when I have read their message?",
        a: "In a direct message, yes, the same way most messengers work. The receipt is only sent when the app is actually open in front of you, so a message that arrives while Airhop is in your pocket stays unread until you look at it. Public and location channels have no receipts at all.",

      {
        q: "Can I talk instead of typing?",
        a: (
          <>
            Yes. Hold the mic button and it behaves like a walkie-talkie: your voice leaves as you
            speak and arrives about half a second later, instead of being recorded and sent when you
            let go. When you release it, the same audio also lands in the chat as an ordinary voice
            note, so anyone who was out of range or joined late still gets it.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is offered in the public Bluetooth channel and in direct messages.{" "}
            <strong>Private channels and groups are excluded on purpose</strong>: a live burst in a
            room is broadcast unencrypted, so streaming one into a room whose text is encrypted
            would quietly undo the thing that makes it private. Location channels are excluded too,
            since that would put your voice on public relays. Holding the mic in any of them records
            a voice note instead, and it does the same when nobody is in range to hear you live, so
            the same gesture always produces something.
            <br />
            <br />
            Live voice can be switched off entirely in Settings, and incoming audio only plays while
            you have that conversation open in front of you. The{" "}

      {
        q: "Does Airhop require internet?",
        a: (
          <>
            No. Chatting, relaying across the mesh, voice notes, images, file transfers, and
            store-and-forward delivery all work with zero internet, over Bluetooth or over a WiFi
            network nobody has to be online for, such as a phone hotspot.
            <br />
            <br />
            For communication beyond Bluetooth range, Airhop automatically uses the{" "}
            <TextLink href="https://fiatjaf.com/nostr.html">Nostr</TextLink> internet fallback to
            reach a contact who is online but out of range. Location channels also require a
            connection.

        ),
      },
      {
        q: "Can Airhop work over WiFi instead of Bluetooth?",
        a: (
          <>
            Yes. Turn on <strong>Local network</strong> in Settings, Network, and phones on the same
            WiFi find each other and carry the whole mesh between them, iPhone and Android alike. No
            internet is involved, so a phone hotspot works with no service at all, and a file moves
            in about a second instead of the minute Bluetooth takes.
            <br />
            <br />
            WiFi here means the network, not the internet behind it. The router only has to let two
            phones talk to each other, and whether it can reach the internet makes no difference.
            That is the opposite of the internet fallback above, which uses Nostr relays to reach
            somebody who is not nearby at all.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is off by default, because announcing yourself on a network is visible to every
            device on it and to whoever runs it. It also depends on the network: many guest, hotel
            and airport networks block devices from talking to each other, which cannot be detected
            in advance, so Airhop simply reports that it found nobody. Home, office and hotspot
            networks generally work.

        q: "What is the difference between Classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy?",
        a: (
          <>
            They are two modes of the same Bluetooth chip in your phone.{" "}
            <TextLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth">Classic Bluetooth</TextLink> is
            the one you already use every day. It pairs two devices and holds the connection open,
            which is what wireless headphones, car audio, and file transfers rely on. It moves data
            quickly, but it drains the battery and only talks to what you have paired.{" "}
            <TextLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy">
              Bluetooth Low Energy
            </TextLink>{" "}
            is the lighter mode. Devices announce themselves and listen in short bursts instead of
            pairing, so one phone can see many nearby devices at once and the radio sleeps between
            packets.
            <br />
            <br />
            Airhop uses Low Energy. Pairing does not work for a mesh where you have never met the
            people around you, and an always-open Classic connection would flatten your battery long
            before the network was useful. Low Energy lets Airhop find peers with no setup and keep
            relaying quietly in the background. The trade is speed, so messages and voice notes
            arrive immediately while a large file takes its time.

        ),
      },
      {
        q: "How does the mesh relay messages?",
        a: "Every phone listens and announces at the same time, so each one is both a receiver and a relay. When a message arrives, your phone checks its signature, drops it if it has already seen it, and passes it on with one of its 7 hops used up. It waits a random fraction of a second first, somewhere between 10 and 220 milliseconds, so that a room full of phones does not all speak at once and drown each other out. Each phone forwards to a sample of nearby devices rather than everyone in range, which is why a crowded mesh does not carry more traffic than a quiet one.",
      },
      {
        q: "How far can messages travel?",
        a: "Each hop covers roughly 10 to 30 meters indoors and up to 100 in the open, and a message is allowed 7 of them, so it can cross a few hundred meters before it stops. The more people around you have Airhop, the further it reaches, because every one of their phones is another relay. Messages held for someone who is not around have no range limit at all: your phone simply carries them until a path to that person exists, however long that takes. That applies to text. An attachment is not carried this way and needs a live link at the moment you send it.",
      },
      {
        q: "What media can I send?",
        a: "Images, voice notes, videos, and any other file format, all over Bluetooth using chunked streaming. Large files are split into fragments, paced so the radio is not overrun, and reassembled on the other side. Videos are sent as files and play inline; they are not live streams. The 1 MiB ceiling is bitchat's, enforced the moment it decodes a packet, so raising it would mean every bitchat peer silently dropping the file; photos and voice notes are capped tighter at 512 KiB for the same reason. Bluetooth carries roughly 18 KiB/s, so a file near the 1 MiB limit takes about 56 seconds, but it works with no internet at all. Over WiFi the gap between fragments is dropped, since it exists for the Bluetooth radio rather than for the protocol, and the same file moves in about a second.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why is there no video or voice calling?",
        a: (
          <>
            Two reasons, and neither of them is a to-do.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Bandwidth.</strong> Bluetooth Low Energy moves roughly 18 KiB/s on a link. Live
            voice fits inside that at about 2 KiB/s, which is exactly why holding the mic works.
            Video does not fit at any quality worth watching, so a call would have to ride the fast
            transports instead.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>The fast transports cannot talk to each other.</strong> They are WiFi Aware on
            Android and MultipeerConnectivity on iPhone: different protocols, with no bridge between
            them. A call built on either could only ever connect Android to Android, or iPhone to
            iPhone. A calling feature that fails on half the pairs is worse than none, so the video
            packet type was removed from the protocol rather than shipped half working.
            <br />
            <br />
            What you get instead is live push-to-talk voice, which covers what a call on a mesh is
            usually for, and video as a file that plays inline in the chat.

        q: "Is Airhop compatible with bitchat?",
        a: (
          <>
            Yes. Wire compatibility means both apps agree on the exact binary format of every byte
            sent over the radio, so no translation layer is needed. Airhop and bitchat share the
            same BLE service identifiers, the same packet byte layout, the same peer identity
            derivation, and the same Noise XX parameters.
            <br />
            <br />
            Place an Airhop device and a bitchat device in the same room and they automatically join
            one mesh, relay each other's messages, and exchange direct messages with no
            configuration and no awareness that different software is running. The full wire format

        q: "Why can't I send a photo or file over the internet?",
        a: (
          <>
            Because the fallback carries text, not media. Attachments travel on the Bluetooth
            file-transfer path and are never bridged to Nostr, so the attach button is offered only
            where the file can actually arrive: the public Bluetooth channel, and direct messages
            with someone reachable over the mesh. It is missing in location channels, in a cell you
            have teleported into, and in a conversation with someone you only know through a relay,
            because everyone there is reached over the internet and the file would go nowhere.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is missing in private channels and groups for a different reason. A direct attachment
            can be sealed inside one person's session, but a broadcast one has no single session to
            seal to, so it goes out signed and readable for bitchat compatibility. Putting that into
            a room whose text is encrypted would quietly undo the privacy of that room. bitchat
            draws the same line in the same places, which is part of how the two apps stay
            predictable to each other.

            In practice:{" "}

            unlike a text message, an attachment does not sit in a queue and send itself later. The

              Nostr is a plain publish-and-relay protocol over WebSockets: your identity is just a
              keypair, there are no accounts or phone numbers, and relays only forward encrypted
              data they cannot read. Airhop already carries a keypair for the mesh, so it reuses
              that with nothing extra to set up. Hundreds of public relays already run on
              independent hosts, so there is nothing for us to operate and no single server to
              trust, and it is the same protocol bitchat uses, so the two apps meet on the same
              relays and stay interoperable.

The mesh bridge links your area's public #bluetooth chat with another Bluetooth crowd that is out of radio range, over the internet, so two separated groups share one conversation.

            <br />
            Public messages are still <strong>signed</strong>, so nobody can forge a message in your

            <br />
            Offline there is no way to check, which is inherent to bearer money: a genuine banknote
            can also have been promised to somebody else. In practice, redeem before handing over

            Two things it does not cover: your identity, chats and contacts, which have no backup at
            all; and coins somebody gave you that you never refreshed, since those carry the
            sender's secrets until they are swapped. The wallet shows exactly how much falls into
            that second category.

            The assistant is optional, and nothing happens until you choose a model. It is a small
            language model that runs entirely on your phone, so you can ask it things when there is
            no signal at all: first aid, navigation, general knowledge. Nothing is sent anywhere,
            there is no API key, and no server sees the question or the answer. Conversation history
            stays on the device with everything else.

            <br />
            <strong>Airhop does not ship a model of its own.</strong> The app lists a few small
            open-weight models (roughly 1 to 3 billion parameters, in GGUF format) with the size and
            memory each one needs, and downloads the one you pick from{" "}
            <TextLink href="https://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</TextLink>. That download is the
            only part that needs internet, and it happens once. The flow is the same on iOS and
            Android, and the app blocks a download outright if the device does not have the memory
            or storage to run it.

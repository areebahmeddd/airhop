// The LAN transport: Bonjour discovery over ordinary TCP.
//
// The only transport that reaches an Android phone from an iPhone over
// something other than Bluetooth. Wi-Fi Aware cannot: Apple requires a paired
// data path and Android has no way to complete Apple's pairing. This is plain
// IP, so it does not care which phone anyone owns.
//
// Framing and the read loop are the same shapes AirhopWiFiModule uses,
// deliberately: both carry the same length-prefixed Airhop packets and a bug
// fixed in one should be recognisable in the other.
//
// Three things differ from that module, each deliberately:
//
//   * Classic `NWConnection` and `NWListener`, not the iOS 26 generic
//     `NetworkConnection<TCP>`. Wi-Fi Aware needs iOS 26 regardless; this must
//     run on the app's floor, and Bonjour over Network framework has been there
//     since iOS 12. No availability gate anywhere below.
//   * Discovery and dialling are split, because Bonjour returns the whole
//     network and who to dial is a decision. TypeScript makes it
//     (services/lan-dial-policy.ts) and this opens what it is told to.
//   * No token tiebreak. The Wi-Fi module needs one because Apple's discovery is
//     symmetric; here the ring already decides which side dials.
//
// The instance name comes from TypeScript and is never the peer ID. See
// services/lan-controller.ts for why it rotates.
//
// Foreground only, structurally. iOS has no background mode for a listening
// socket, and a suspended app has its listener reclaimed without getting it back
// on resume. Bluetooth keeps the mesh alive with the screen off, and the Network
// screen says so.

// AirhopTorManager.swift
//
// Arti-based Tor integration for Airhop.
//
// Boots the embedded Tor client from native/arti and exposes its SOCKS5 proxy
// on 127.0.0.1:39050. NostrClient and anything else internet-bound routes
// through that port; nothing else in the app talks to Tor.
//
// Binary dependency: ios/Frameworks/arti.xcframework, built by
// native/arti/build-apple.sh from native/arti/src. The header beside the
// library is generated from src/ffi_c.rs, so the declarations below and the Rust
// they bind to cannot drift without the build saying so.

//
// Bound by symbol rather than through a bridging header, which keeps the Xcode
// target free of a modulemap for a handful of functions. A missing symbol is a link
// error; what the linker cannot catch is one present in a device slice and
// absent from a simulator slice, which build-apple.sh checks for.

// AirhopIPtProxy.swift
//
// The pluggable transports Arti dials to reach a bridge, built from
// native/iptproxy.
//
// Arti would normally run obfs4 and Snowflake as child processes, which iOS
// forbids. IPtProxy runs them in-process and exposes each as a SOCKS5 listener
// on loopback; this owns their lifecycle and reports the ports they landed on.
//
// Not main-actor isolated, and deliberately so: starting a transport launches a
// listener and, for Snowflake, contacts a broker over the network. Callers run
// it off the main thread, the same way they do Arti's own start.
//
// Mirrors android .../tor/AirhopIPtProxy.kt.

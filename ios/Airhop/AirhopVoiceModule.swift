// AirhopVoiceModule: live push-to-talk audio for Airhop.
//
// iOS counterpart of AirhopVoiceModule.kt, with the same contract: the mic
// becomes a stream of AAC-LC frames, and a stream of AAC-LC frames becomes
// sound. No protocol, no routing, no buffering policy: those live in
// voice-capture.ts, flood-router.ts, and voice-player.ts respectively.
//
// Format is fixed by the wire protocol (VoiceBurstCodec.aacLC16kMono = 0x01,
// shared with bitchat): AAC-LC, 16 kHz, mono, 16 kbps, 1024 samples per frame,
// raw frames with no ADTS header. AVAudioConverter produces exactly that.
//
// Threading contract: every exported method returns immediately. Capture runs
// on the audio engine's own render thread and playback on an AVAudioPlayerNode,
// so neither the JS thread nor the UI can be stalled by audio work.
//
// Events emitted to TypeScript:
//   AirhopVoice.frame         { dataBase64 }
//   AirhopVoice.captureError  { message }

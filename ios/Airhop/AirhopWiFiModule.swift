// AirhopWiFiModule: Wi-Fi Aware high-bandwidth transport for Airhop (iOS).
//
// Apple's WiFiAware framework, iOS 26+. Same three methods, four events and
// rejection codes as AirhopWiFiModule.kt, so services/wifi-controller.ts drives
// both platforms without knowing which. No protocol or routing logic here: raw
// bytes to TypeScript, as AirhopBLEModule does.
//
// Events emitted to TypeScript:
//   AirhopWiFi.packetReceived      { linkID, dataBase64 }
//   AirhopWiFi.linkConnected       { linkID }
//   AirhopWiFi.linkDisconnected    { linkID }
//   AirhopWiFi.availabilityChanged { available }
//
// Still not a cross-platform path: Apple demands a paired data path and refuses
// an open one, and Android cannot complete Apple's pairing.
//
// Two of Apple's rules shape the whole file:
//
// NetworkConnection has no cancel. A connection ends when the last reference is
// dropped, so one task per link owns its connection for the link's life and
// closing means cancelling that task. The registry holds a reference for writes,
// which is why `serve`'s defer removes it.
//
// Discovery is symmetric with no serviceSpecificInfo to break a tie before
// connecting, so each pair would open two connections and MeshService would
// rebind `wifiPeerToLink` to whichever announced last. Hence the link hello.

// AirhopBLEModule: dual-role BLE GATT server + central for Airhop mesh.
//
// This module does exactly four things and nothing else:
//   1. Advertise as a GATT Peripheral with the Airhop service UUID.
//   2. Scan as a GATT Central for peers advertising the same UUID.
//   3. Accept incoming writes from connected peers and emit them to TypeScript.
//   4. Write raw bytes from TypeScript to connected peers.
//
// Protocol logic (routing, TTL, deduplication, signing) lives entirely in
// TypeScript (src/core/). This file has no knowledge of packet types.

// MARK: - Launch-time state restoration

// Holds the CoreBluetooth managers between process start and this module
// existing.
//
// iOS relaunches a terminated app when a restorable BLE session sees an event,
// and expects the manager with the matching restore identifier to be recreated
// inside application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:). React Native cannot:
// the module is built by the bridge and its managers later still, on the first
// call from JS, by which point the restoration callback has been delivered to
// nobody.
//
// Constructing them at launch unconditionally is not an option either, since
// allocating a CBCentralManager raises the iOS Bluetooth prompt and every new
// user would meet it on the splash screen. So the app delegate calls prepare()
// only when launchOptions carries a Bluetooth restoration key, which happens
// only for an app that already had a live session and therefore already has the
// permission. First run never takes the branch.
//
// Everything here runs on AirhopBLEQueue.shared, so the handover needs no
// locking: prepare() is enqueued from didFinishLaunching and the take* calls
// later, and a serial queue preserves that order.

    Binary xcframework wrapping Airhop's Arti-based Tor client.

    Built from native/arti by native/arti/build-apple.sh, not vendored from
    upstream: the Rust source, the pinned toolchain and the checksum manifest
    all live in this repository. Exposes a C ABI consumed by
    AirhopTorManager.swift through @_silgen_name; build-apple.sh holds the list
    of entry points and fails when one is missing from any slice.

    The header beside the library is generated from native/arti/src/ffi_c.rs by
    cbindgen, so it cannot disagree with the Rust it describes.

  # sqlite3 is very likely redundant: the crate is built with arti-client's
  # `static-sqlite`, and the Android library produced from the same source has no
  # undefined sqlite symbols. Kept until a macOS build confirms the same there,
  # because linking a library nothing references costs nothing.

    Binary xcframework wrapping Lyrebird (obfs4) and Snowflake as a library.

    Built from pinned sources by native/iptproxy/build-apple.sh, not taken from
    the upstream pod: that one installs a prebuilt binary committed to their
    repository, and everything Airhop ships is compiled here and hashed in
    vendor.lock.json.

    Arti would normally run these as child processes, which iOS forbids. They
    run in-process instead and expose a SOCKS5 listener each, which
    AirhopIPtProxy.swift starts and AirhopTorManager.swift hands to Arti.

// Regenerates src/data/relays.ts and landing/src/data/relays.ts from
// assets/data/nostr_relays.csv.
//
// The relay directory ships as a TypeScript module rather than being parsed
// from the CSV at runtime, because Metro does not bundle .csv as an asset and
// the file would be unreachable from the app.
//
// The CSV is vendored in this repo at assets/data/nostr_relays.csv and is the
// single source of truth at runtime. Airhop does NOT fetch a relay list at
// runtime from any third-party URL. Bundling it means no network dependency on
// first launch, no third party learning who is asking for relays, and no fetch
// to fail offline (which is exactly when this app matters most).
//
// Upstream: .github/workflows/sync-relays.yml proposes a weekly refresh of the
// vendored CSV from bitchat's reviewed directory, as a pull request for review.
//
// Rows are canonicalized, not copied: the feed lists many hosts twice, bare and
// with an explicit :443, and those are one relay. The CSV stays byte-identical
// to upstream so it can be diffed against the source; this module is the form
// the app loads.
//
// Run after updating that CSV:
//   node scripts/generate-relays.js

## 2. Identity

An Airhop identity is a key pair generated on the device, stored in the OS
keychain, and never transmitted to any server. There are no accounts.

### Key pair

```
Identity
├── Noise Static Key   (X25519)     - session encryption (Noise XX handshake)
├── Signing Key        (Ed25519)    - packet, board, prekey and group authentication
├── Nostr Key          (secp256k1)  - derived from the signing key; the Nostr identity
└── Peer ID            (string)     - SHA-256(noiseStaticPub).slice(0, 8 bytes), 16 hex chars
```

Nostr uses secp256k1, so the Ed25519 signing key cannot serve as an `npub`. The
Nostr key is derived from it by HKDF (`deriveNostrPrivKey`), which gives one root
identity a single stable Nostr identity across mesh, relays and payments with no
link to a phone number or email. Location channels derive a further per-geohash
secp256k1 identity, so presence in one cell cannot be linked to another.

### Names

Usernames are derived from the public key, never chosen:

```
peerID 3a9f2c1b -> "swift-falcon-3a9f"
```

A name cannot be claimed without the key it comes from, so no Airhop user can
take another's. It does not make impersonation impossible on the mesh: a bitchat
peer chooses its own nickname freely and Airhop renders what it announces, which
is why a public-channel sender is always shown with a `#last4` suffix taken from
the peer ID.

Your generated nickname is fixed after setup. Real identity is confirmed
separately, two ways:

- **Scanning their QR in person.** The camera witnesses the exchange, so this is
  also the only route allowed to re-pin keys already bound to a peer ID.
- **Comparing a safety number.** Six words derived from both parties' Noise and
  signing keys, identical on both phones, read to each other over a channel they
  trust. Confirms keys already held rather than importing any, so it grants no
  re-pinning power and needs none. This is what lets somebody you can only reach
  by call or radio be verified at all.

Both earn the same badge. `source` records how the keys arrived (`qr`, `link` or
`manual`), `verification` records whether a human has checked them; they are
independent, so a contact learned from a link can be verified on a call.

Either person may assign the other a local nickname once their keys are held.
That label never leaves the device and never touches the cryptographic identity,
and the sheet keeps showing the name the peer chose beside it.

### Anti-impersonation

- Every packet carries an Ed25519 signature from the sender.
- Receivers verify signatures before displaying or acting on a message.
- Unsigned and invalid-signature packets are dropped before display.
- Relaying is separate from verification. A node forwards opaque bytes it may not
  be able to check, since it may not hold the sender's key yet, and the flood
  router runs before per-type verification.

### Key storage

| Secret               | Storage                         | Backed by                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `noiseStaticPrivKey` | `expo-secure-store`             | iOS Keychain / Android Keystore   |
| `signingPrivKey`     | `expo-secure-store`             | iOS Keychain / Android Keystore   |
| Wallet AES-256 key   | `expo-secure-store`             | iOS Keychain / Android Keystore   |
| Nutzap P2PK privkey  | `expo-secure-store`             | iOS Keychain / Android Keystore   |
| Recovery phrase      | `expo-secure-store`             | iOS Keychain / Android Keystore   |
| Cashu proofs         | `react-native-mmkv` (AES-256)   | File encrypted with the key above |
| Active sessions      | `react-native-mmkv` (encrypted) | RAM-backed, not persisted         |
| Message history      | `react-native-mmkv`             | Encrypted at rest, panic-wipeable |

All five go through `src/core/crypto/keychain.ts`; nothing else calls
`expo-secure-store` directly. The module exports a union type of the item names,
so a caller cannot write a secret outside the registry.

That registry is what the panic wipe walks, since `expo-secure-store` has no
delete-all. A secret stored under an ad-hoc key would survive the wipe. Every
item is attempted even after one fails, and anything left behind is reported as
`keysDestroyed: false` rather than as success.

Items are written `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` rather than the
`WHEN_UNLOCKED` default. `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK` because iOS relaunches the app on a
BLE event after termination and that relaunch must load the identity to join the
mesh; `WHEN_UNLOCKED` refuses the read on a locked phone. `THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`
because the default class is included in encrypted iCloud and iTunes backups and
restorable onto another device. The trade is that the keychain is unreadable
between boot and the first unlock.

### Storage key names

Three families of string, all currently at `v1`.

| Family                    | Shape                        | Example                 | Renaming costs                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Keychain item             | `airhop.<domain>.<thing>.v1` | `airhop.wallet.p2pk.v1` | The secret becomes unreachable      |
| HKDF domain separator     | `airhop-<purpose>-v1`        | `airhop-dr-root-v1`     | Every key derived from it changes   |
| Persisted store / MMKV id | `<name>-store`               | `wallet-store`          | The user's data becomes unreachable |

The third family has three names that predate the convention: `airhop-chat`,
`wallet-state` (beside the `wallet-store` partition), and `activity`. They stay
as they are. A persisted name is the address of the data, not a label on it, so
renaming one points the next launch at a file that has never been written while
the old data stays on disk with nothing referencing it. No store declares a
`migrate`. Changing these safely means a per-store migration that reads the old
name and writes the new, shipped at least one release before the old name is
dropped.

### Wallet partition

Cashu proofs are bearer instruments, so `wallet-store` is the one MMKV partition
opened with an explicit `encryptionKey`. The key is 24 random bytes, base64
encoded to the 32 ASCII characters AES-256 allows, generated on first run and
held in the keychain. It is fetched asynchronously, so the store cannot exist at
module scope: `bootstrapWalletStorage()` opens it and every `zustand/persist`
read and write awaits that promise. If the keychain refuses, the wallet reports
itself locked rather than opening unencrypted, and no proof reaches plaintext
disk.

The panic wipe deletes this partition with `deleteMMKV` rather than `clearAll`,
since the file cannot be reopened without its key and the same wipe destroys the
key.

## 3. Transport Stack

Messages route through the best available transport with no user involvement.
The interface is the same whichever radio carries the message.

```
MessageRouter.ts - transport selection

Local radios, used together:
  BLE Mesh          - recipient is nearby, confirmed by announce
  WiFi Aware        - both parties have it active and are in range (~30m), and on iOS are paired

Ordered fallbacks, tried when no local radio reaches the recipient:
1. Nostr Relay       - internet available, recipient confirmed offline
2. Courier           - everything else failed (spray-and-wait through mesh peers)
```

The two local radios are not a priority ladder. A message addressed to a peer is
TTL bounded and flooded on every link the device has, because no node knows the
mesh topology and the recipient may be several hops away. WiFi and BLE therefore
carry the same packet at the same time, and a packet that enters on one radio is
relayed out on the other. Duplicates are collapsed by the seen set and by a
sender generated message ID, so a message is displayed once however many radios
delivered it.

The one place a radio is chosen rather than used alongside the other is the
direct link shortcut. Once a peer has been mapped to a specific link, a packet
addressed to it goes over WiFi if that mapping is a WiFi link, since the point of
the fast path is to move an attachment that BLE would have to fragment into
hundreds of writes. This is an optimization, not the delivery guarantee.

### BLE mesh

Identical to bitchat's design:

- Dual-role: every device is both GATT Central (scanner) and GATT Peripheral (advertiser)
- Service UUID `F47B5E2D-4A9E-4C5A-9B3F-8E1D2C3A4B5C`, bitchat-compatible
- TTL 7 hops, decremented per relay
- Jitter of 10 to 220 ms before relay, which prevents cascade storms
- Dedup against a 1000-entry LRU seen-set, 5 minute nonce expiry
- Fragments of 467 data bytes inside a 512-byte frame, the BLE write ceiling
- Up to 128 concurrent reassemblies
- Range of roughly 30 to 50 m per hop, so 7 hops reaches about 350 m

### LAN transport

WiFi Aware is a radio protocol rather than a way of using a network: two phones
on the same router cannot reach each other over it, and it cannot cross
platforms, because Apple demands a paired data path that Android cannot
complete. So an iPhone and an Android sharing a WiFi network have no local path
between them, which is the gap on a ship, in a hotel, at a conference, or
anywhere with WiFi and no route out.

mDNS discovery on `_airhop-lan-v1._tcp` plus TCP links closes it. The links carry
the same packet frames BLE carries, so the mesh engine needs no new concept and
the wire format does not move. It sits beside WiFi Aware rather than replacing
it: Aware needs no network at all, which mDNS cannot do, and mDNS reaches
everyone on a network, which Aware cannot. The service name is kept apart from
Aware's `_airhop-mesh-v1._tcp` so neither reads as a typo of the other.

Two decisions are unique to it.

**Who to connect to.** Bluetooth answers this with physics: the radio holds six
or so links and refuses more. mDNS returns the whole network, and taking all of
it is quadratic. Thirty phones fully connected is 435 sockets, and one broadcast
costs 841 writes instead of 29 because every phone relays to everyone it holds
and the deduplicator discards the copies; a channel photo turns that into
millions of writes for one file. The arithmetic is not LAN's. Bluetooth is saved
from it only by the radio refusing the links.

So LAN caps at 8, sized against bitchat's `bleMaxCentralLinks` of 6, which keeps
a LAN room reading the way a Bluetooth room does to every constant tuned for
Bluetooth density. Names are sorted into one ring and a device links to the four
either side of it, dialling only those sorting after its own so no pair is
dialled twice. Both ends compute the same ring, so they agree without
negotiating, and below the cap the ring wraps and everyone is a neighbour, which
is right for a hotspot. `src/services/lan-dial-policy.ts` holds the rule as a
pure function; the native modules open the sockets they are told to.

**What to publish.** The instance name is random and minted per publishing
session, never the peer ID: an mDNS record is cleartext to the network and is
logged by ordinary infrastructure, so a stable name would let anyone holding
logs from two networks link them. The ring sorts on that random name, so
discovery needs no durable identifier, and identity is proven in the ANNOUNCE
once the link is up.

This is the only transport off by default. Publishing tells every device on the
network, and whoever runs it, that this phone is carrying Airhop, which on a
workplace or venue network is an attendance list. The Settings copy says that
rather than selling the speed.

| Constraint       | Consequence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Client isolation | Most guest and venue WiFi blocks peer-to-peer traffic at the access point, and it cannot be detected before trying. The UI has to say "No Airhop devices on this network" rather than spin                                                                                                                         |

| iOS background   | A TCP socket has no equivalent of `bluetooth-central`, and a suspended app has its listener reclaimed without getting it back on resume. Foreground only, which WiFi Aware already is on iOS                                                                                                                       |
| Hotspot hosts    | A phone sharing its connection serves the network rather than joins it, so `ConnectivityManager` has no `Network` for it. Availability is read off the interfaces instead. Android has served mDNS on that interface since 13; below that the host sees an empty network, which reads the same as client isolation |

### Same-platform WiFi

Both platforms run WiFi Aware, the Wi-Fi Alliance's NAN. Same protocol, same
service name, same length-prefixed frames, one TypeScript contract
(`src/bridge/NativeAirhopWiFi.ts`) and one reconciler
(`src/services/wifi-controller.ts`).

- Android: [`WifiAwareManager`](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/wifi/wifi-aware), 250 Mbps, no internet or router. Discovery is API 26, but the data path needs API 29: the peer's address is a link-local IPv6 delivered in `WifiAwareNetworkInfo`, which does not exist before then, so below API 29 the transport reports itself unavailable and BLE carries everything. Android 17 additionally gates the socket behind `ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK`, declared already
- iOS: [`WiFiAware`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WiFiAware) on Network framework, iOS 26 and iPhone 12 or later. Needs the `com.apple.developer.wifi-aware` entitlement, which is a managed capability rather than a switch in Xcode, and the service declared in `Info.plist` under `WiFiAwareServices`
- Same `Transport` interface as BLE, so the mesh engine does not know which radio it has
- No power policy of its own. `src/services/power-policy.ts` scales the BLE radios and leaves this one alone on both platforms: Aware is withdrawn by the OS under battery saver rather than dialled down by the app, and both surface that through `availabilityChanged(false)` and the controller's retry ladder. iOS additionally costs nothing while nothing is paired, since it never attaches and is never retried
- Carries an attachment at link speed. The 467-byte fragments stay, since the receiver reassembles by index and the next hop may be Bluetooth, but the 25 ms gap between them goes: it exists because the BLE stack drops writes handed over faster than it can make them, and a socket has flow control of its own. `src/services/file-transfer-service.ts` paces on one question, whether anything on the path touches the Bluetooth radio

Three things are true only on iOS, and each shapes the code:

| Constraint                                                                                                                                        | Consequence                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No unpaired mode. Every target a listener or browser can name comes from the app's paired list, and the only way into that list is a system sheet | A pairing gate in the controller, a second native module for the sheet (`AirhopWiFiPairing`), and a `unpaired` state that is reported rather than retried, because only a pairing changes it                           |
| Discovery is symmetric, and Apple exposes no `serviceSpecificInfo` to break a tie with before connecting                                          | An 8-byte token exchanged as the first frame of every connection. Both ends keep the one whose initiator holds the lower token, and the loser is closed before TypeScript is ever told a link existed                  |
| `NetworkConnection` has no cancel. A connection ends when the last reference to it is dropped                                                     | One task per link owns its connection for the whole life of the link. Closing means cancelling that task, not calling a method, and the registry entry is removed on the way out or the connection outlives its reader |

Pairing is also two-sided, the way Bluetooth pairing is: one phone browses and
the other advertises, at the same moment. That is a user-visible cost with no
one-tap version to build, so it lives on one screen (Settings, Network) that
says which half each person is playing, rather than being hidden behind a button
that would work half the time.

### Nostr

- 300+ public relays from the georelays dataset, bundled as `assets/data/nostr_relays.csv`
- Relays selected by [Haversine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) distance from the device, for lowest latency
- NIP-17-shaped gift-wrap for private DMs, so no message content or metadata reaches relays. The layering is NIP-17's; the encryption inside each layer is bitchat's `nip44-v2` rather than the published NIP-44, and has to be, since the event signature covers the ciphertext and interop is byte-for-byte. See [PROTOCOLS.md section 7.1](PROTOCOLS.md#71-the-nostr-dm-construction-is-not-the-published-nip-44)
- Kinds 20000 and 20001 for geohash channels and presence heartbeats
- `SimplePool` connects to 3 to 5 relays at once and takes the first ACK, so no single relay is load-bearing
- Tor off by default on both platforms, behind one toggle

### Radio power policy (Android)

BLE scanning is the largest battery cost in the app. A continuous
`SCAN_MODE_LOW_LATENCY` scan costs roughly an order of magnitude more than
`SCAN_MODE_LOW_POWER`, and the app is meant to run in a pocket all day, so the
radios scale with what the device can afford.

Policy lives in TypeScript, mechanism in Kotlin. `src/services/power-policy.ts`
is a pure function of four facts; the native module reports the battery and
applies whichever mode it is given, and decides nothing itself. This keeps the
decision testable without a device and puts "how hard to run the radios" beside
"whether to run them at all" in `src/services/radio-controller.ts`.

Battery bands match bitchat-android's `AppConstants.Power`: critical at `≤10%`,
low at `≤20%`.

| Mode              | Scan          | Advertise     | TX power    | RSSI poll | Duty cycle      |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| `performance`     | `LOW_LATENCY` | `LOW_LATENCY` | `HIGH`      | 5s        | continuous      |
| `balanced`        | `BALANCED`    | `BALANCED`    | `MEDIUM`    | 10s       | continuous      |
| `power-saver`     | `LOW_POWER`   | `LOW_POWER`   | `LOW`       | 30s       | 2s on / 28s off |
| `ultra-low-power` | `LOW_POWER`   | `LOW_POWER`   | `ULTRA_LOW` | 60s       | 1s on / 29s off |

Selection order matches bitchat's `PowerProfileResolver`, and the order carries
the policy:

1. Backgrounded gives `power-saver`, or `ultra-low-power` on a critical battery.
   Nobody is waiting on discovery latency off screen, and this is where a phone
   spends nearly all of its day.
2. Charging in the foreground gives `performance`, since the cost is someone else's.
3. Otherwise the battery band decides: critical gives `ultra-low-power`, low
   gives `power-saver`, anything else gives `balanced`.

Foreground on battery is `balanced` rather than `performance` because a balanced
scan still finds peers within seconds, and reserving the most expensive setting
for "plugged in" is what stops the app being the reason a phone dies.

> [!NOTE]
> The five knobs move together. A duty-cycled `LOW_POWER` scan beside a
> `LOW_LATENCY` advertise at full TX power saves almost nothing, since the
> advertiser transmits continuously either way.

Hysteresis is Airhop's addition. bitchat re-resolves on every
`ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED`, which fires per 1%, so a phone hovering at a threshold
flips modes repeatedly and every flip restarts the scanner. Dropping into a lower
band is immediate, since running hard on a nearly flat phone is the failure that
matters; climbing back out needs `+3%`.

The duty cycle is invisible above the native boundary. JS asks for scanning and
keeps getting it while native decides the rate. A burst ending is never reported
as an adapter or link change, or the reconciler would try to repair a state that
is working correctly.

In the foreground on a low battery, peers can take up to half a minute to appear,
which is indistinguishable from a broken mesh unless it is stated. The Mesh tab
shows a muted `Battery saver · scanning less often` note, with no button since
charging is the fix, and no dismiss since it clears itself. It stays silent while
backgrounded, where nobody is waiting on the scan.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> iOS is a declared no-op. CoreBluetooth exposes no scan-rate control and already
> throttles background BLE aggressively. `setPowerMode` exists on both platforms

> mode alone.

## 4. Messaging Protocol

### Wire format (bitchat v2)

Airhop is wire-compatible with bitchat in both directions. Airhop nodes appear as
ordinary peers to bitchat devices, and bitchat drops Airhop's extension packet
types as unknown without disruption.

> See [`PROTOCOLS.md`](PROTOCOLS.md) for the [byte layout](PROTOCOLS.md#2-packet-frame-layout), [packet type registry](PROTOCOLS.md#3-packet-type-registry), [routing constants](PROTOCOLS.md#4-routing-constants) and every other protocol constant.

### Routing

| Traffic          | Method                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Public channel   | TTL flood; every peer rebroadcasts with TTL decremented            |
| Direct message   | Flood with a recipient ID; only the recipient decrypts             |
| Courier envelope | Spray-and-wait; trusted peers carry sealed blobs for offline peers |

## 5. Encryption

### Sessions: Noise XX

```
Protocol: Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256
```

Used for every live DM session, over whichever direct link the peer is on.

- Pattern XX mutually authenticates both parties, each sending their static key encrypted
- Ephemeral keys are fresh per session, so a leaked static key does not expose past sessions
- Neither party can prove to a third party what was said

The handshake produces `send` and `recv` keys. Messages are then encrypted with
[ChaCha20-Poly1305](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7539) under a counter
nonce, which prevents replay.

### Stored messages: [Double Ratchet](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/)

Used for DMs held in the courier and the offline outbox.

- Per-message forward secrecy: compromise of message N does not expose N-1 or N+1
- Break-in recovery: if current keys leak, future messages are protected again after a few ratchet steps
- One-time prekeys are signed and gossiped over the mesh as `0x24`, never published to Nostr. A sender seals courier mail to one, so undelivered mail stays protected even if the recipient's long-lived key leaks later

X3DH is not used, since the Noise handshake already seeds the ratchet.

The seed is the handshake's exporter secret, a third HKDF output of `split()`
alongside the two transport keys, descending from the Noise chaining key. Both
sides already hold it, so it costs no extra round trips, and because the chaining
key absorbs ephemeral DH outputs whose private halves are destroyed at split, it
cannot be reconstructed from long-term keys. It must not be the transcript hash:
`mixHash` absorbs only bytes that went over the wire, so that value is public to
anyone who captured the handshake, and handshakes flood the mesh at TTL 7. Nor a
static-static ECDH, which would stay derivable from long-term keys forever.

### Packet signing: [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/)

- Signed before transmission, verified before display or action
- The signature covers every packet field except TTL and the signature itself
- Replay is bounded by a millisecond timestamp plus a deduplicator that rejects any packet ID already seen. There is no nonce field. Where staleness is itself the attack, a freshness window backs this up: 15 minutes for announces, 30 seconds for live voice. The deduplicator is per-device and cannot speak for a phone that never heard the original

### Summary

| Traffic          | Protection                                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Live DM session  | Noise XX: mutual auth, forward secrecy per session                         |
| Stored DM        | Double Ratchet: forward secrecy per message                                |
| Public channel   | Plaintext plus Ed25519 signature, readable by every peer                   |
| Courier envelope | Noise X one-way seal to the recipient's static key, wrapping DR ciphertext |
| Nostr DM         | bitchat's `nip44-v2` inside a NIP-17-shaped gift-wrap. See below           |

## 6. Channels and Groups

### Mesh channels

Channels are prefixed with `#`, as in bitchat, and are registered nowhere.
Anyone broadcasting on `#channel-name` participates.

- No server and no registration
- A 6 hour public message window, reconciled by gossip sync on connect
- A channel exists as soon as someone broadcasts on it; there is no membership advertisement
- Moderation is a client-side block list; muted peer IDs are not surfaced

### Private channels (Airhop only)

An invite-only room. A symmetric key is generated at creation and travels inside
the invite link, so anyone holding the link can read. There is no roster and no
member cap, so the link can spread faster than anyone could add people by hand.

- Sealed with XChaCha20-Poly1305 and broadcast as `0x50`
- Reach is the creator's choice: Bluetooth only, or Bluetooth plus Nostr, where the same sealed blob is published so out-of-range members receive it
- bitchat relays `0x50` without interpreting it, so the two coexist

### Private groups (bitchat compatible)

A fixed set of people rather than a place. The creator signs a roster of up to 16
members and delivers the group key to each member inside their Noise session. No
link exists, so nobody can forward their way in.

- Messages are sealed with ChaCha20-Poly1305 under the current epoch key and broadcast as `0x25`, with group ID and epoch in the clear so relays can carry them
- Bluetooth only. Group messages do not bridge to Nostr, so a member who walks out of range stops receiving until they return
- Rotating the key bumps the epoch; older epochs are refused
- A group pins the `creatorFingerprint` it was created with, and a state naming a different creator is refused even at a higher epoch

### NIP-29 was not used

Relay-hosted groups put membership enforcement on a relay, which makes a server
the authority on who may speak. Both models above keep that decision on the
devices holding the keys.

### One channel, two transports

A public location channel exists on both transports at once:

1. BLE mesh when offline, relaying through nearby devices
2. Nostr when internet is available, through relays chosen near the cell

Reconnecting after time offline reconciles the gap through GCS gossip sync, the
mechanism bitchat uses.

A teleported cell is the exception. When a user opens a location channel by its
geohash rather than by being there, nobody in Bluetooth range is in it, so it runs
over Nostr only. Its messages carry a `t=teleport` tag, and bitchat lists the
sender as teleported rather than nearby.

## 7. Payments

### Why Cashu

Cashu is a Chaumian ecash protocol built on blind signatures. Tokens are strings
that carry value.

- Transfer is fully offline: a token string sent over BLE moves the value immediately
- The token is a bearer instrument, so whoever holds it owns it
- Redemption to Lightning or Bitcoin needs internet access to the mint
- The mint tracks spent proofs, so the recipient should redeem once online
- Blind signatures stop the mint linking issuance to redemption
- Tokens split and combine down to 1 sat

### Token in a message

A payment is a message whose body is a token string. The same channel or DM that
carries text carries the payment, and the recipient's app renders it as a payment
card.

```
Message body example:
💸 500 sats - coffee money
cashuBo3Blk4J...
```

The token flows over BLE like any other message: encrypted in a DM, signed always.

### Nutzaps (NIP-61)

With internet available, a payment can address a Nostr identity instead of a
conversation.

1. Fetch the recipient's `kind:10019`, which lists trusted mints and a P2PK pubkey
2. Mint or swap ecash P2PK-locked to that pubkey
3. Publish a `kind:9321` nutzap event **to the recipient's relays**, which is where they subscribe
4. The recipient's client swaps the token into their wallet, refusing outright if the event names a mint they do not already hold
5. History stays local in `wallet-store`; Airhop publishes no NIP-60 events

### Choosing a rail

Every entry point that pays somebody (DM attach menu, contact sheet, Mesh peer
sheet, Wallet Zap) calls `payPerson` in `services/payment-router.ts`, so the four
screens cannot disagree about what a payment does.

| Order | Rail   | When                                                                                                            | Reclaimable |
| ----- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1     | Radio  | A direct BLE or WiFi link exists (`MeshService.hasDirectLink`)                                                  | Yes         |
| 2     | Nutzap | No radio link, their Nostr key is known, they published a `kind:10019`, and we hold value at a mint they accept | No          |
| 3     | Token  | Anything else. `MeshService.sendDm` picks Nostr gift-wrap, a courier, or the outbox                             | Yes         |
| 4     | Manual | Nothing carried it, so the token string returns for the user to hand over                                       | Yes         |

Radio comes first so that someone standing in front of you does not wait on a
mint round trip, and so the in-person case keeps working with no internet. Rail 2
is preferred over rail 3 when available, because locked proofs are the
recipient's whether or not they ever come online, where a bearer token is theirs
only once claimed.

Two rules hold across the ladder:

- **One commitment per payment.** Proofs are either reserved (rails 1, 3, 4) or P2PK-locked (rail 2), never both. A rail that fails before committing falls through to the next; a rail that fails after committing retries delivery only.
- **Finality is reported, never inferred.** `PayResult.final` is true for rail 2 alone, and every confirmation names the rail that carried the money and says whether Pending will offer it back.

### Payment security model

| Attack              | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Double-spend        | The mint is the only authority. A proof received offline is stored as unverified and never claimed as confirmed; `refreshAccount` runs a NUT-07 state check and swaps, and anything the mint reports spent is removed from the balance rather than shown as money |
| Fake token          | NUT-12 DLEQ verification against the mint's cached public keys on every received token. A failing witness is rejected before the store sees it. Missing keys report "unchecked", never "valid"                                                                    |
| Inflated amount     | Amounts come from the decoded proofs rather than a self-declared field, and every proof is bounded before being summed                                                                                                                                            |
| Token interception  | DMs encrypt the token in transit. A token posted to a public channel is a bearer instrument anyone reading can redeem, which the UI states before sending                                                                                                         |
| Interrupted send    | Proofs move to a reserved bucket rather than being deleted, and the serialised token stays on the transaction. An abandoned sheet, a crash, or a DM that never routes leaves the value reclaimable                                                                |
| Mint failure        | The user chooses which mints to trust. Balances are per (mint, unit) and never pooled, so one mint failing cannot take the rest                                                                                                                                   |
| Proofs at rest      | The MMKV partition is AES-256 encrypted under a keychain-held key. If that key is unavailable the wallet locks rather than falling back to plaintext                                                                                                              |
| IP linkage over Tor | On iOS, Tor wraps only Nostr WebSockets, so mint HTTP would bypass it. Mint calls are refused while Tor is on unless the user opts in. Android routes every socket through the proxy, so nothing is left to refuse                                                |

### Recovery

The seed exists from the first launch: a 12-word BIP-39 phrase is generated and
stored in the keychain beside the identity keys before the first mint
operation, so every proof the wallet creates uses NUT-13 deterministic secrets
from day one. What is off by default is the backup itself: the shield turns on
only once the user has viewed the phrase and confirmed they hold it, since
"covered" is a promise about the person, not the crypto. Recovery (NUT-09)
re-derives those secrets on any device and asks each mint which of them it
signed, so the balance is rebuilt from the mint's records rather than from a
backup file.

| Coverage |                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Covers   | Ecash derived from the phrase, at mints the user re-adds                                                                                         |
| Excludes | The Airhop identity, chats, contacts and the mint list                                                                                           |
| Excludes | Coins received and never swapped, which carry the sender's secrets. They come under the phrase once swapped, which is what `refreshAccount` does |

- The keychain is the source of truth. If the flag says backup is on but the phrase is gone, startup clears the flag and seeds a fresh phrase, which covers coins from then on rather than claiming coverage the user does not have. If the keychain refuses the write, the wallet falls back to random secrets and says nothing is covered.
- `StoredProof.derived` tracks which proofs the phrase can rebuild, and the UI shows the uncovered remainder rather than folding it into a green tick.
- There is no way to turn backup off, since deleting a phrase that coins derive from is indistinguishable from deleting the coins. Only the panic wipe removes it.

Counters are the one place this can go wrong. Re-deriving a counter recreates a
secret the mint has already signed and the swap is rejected. The cursor is
persisted per keyset, only moves forward, and restore pushes it past everything
the mint has on record. A rejected swap leaves the input proofs untouched, so the
failure mode is a retry rather than a loss.

### Moving between mints

A token names exactly one mint, so ecash from two mints can never be combined
into one token. `consolidateMints` moves the value instead: the destination mint
issues a Lightning invoice and the source mint pays it, leaving the balance at
one mint for one routing fee and no external wallet.

Two limits that wallets often blur:

- DLEQ proves origin, not freshness. A valid witness proves the mint signed that proof. It cannot prove the sender has not already spent it. Only the mint knows that, and only over the network.
- Reclaiming an undelivered send is not free. The proofs are still valid at the mint, so the reclaim works, but if the recipient also holds the token string then whoever reaches the mint first keeps the value. The UI says so before reclaiming.

| Consolidate | Move a split balance onto one mint over Lightning                                                                                      |
| History     | Every send, receive, deposit, withdrawal, nutzap and swap, with status                                                                 |

The mint is a minimal trust party and holds no custody of the device's proofs.

### Library

`@cashu/cashu-ts` v4.7 (MIT, TypeScript-first, ESM) owns proof selection (RGLI),
fee arithmetic, blinding, and the mint HTTP surface.
`src/services/wallet-service.ts` owns everything above it.

## 8. Privacy and Tor

### Metadata minimization

- No phone numbers, email addresses or registered usernames
- No IP address reaches a relay while Tor is active
- NIP-17 gift-wrap hides who is talking to whom from relay operators
- BLE mesh is radio-local, requires physical proximity, and leaves no internet signature
- Geolocation is opt-in, used for geohash presence, and never stored or transmitted otherwise
- No plaintext message is written to disk, and the panic wipe destroys all keys

### Tor

Both platforms embed [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti), the
Tor Project's Rust client, built from `native/arti/`: one crate, one SOCKS5
listener on `127.0.0.1:39050`, two thin FFI faces. There is no `tor` binary, no
`torrc`, no control port and no third-party app. Off by default on both.

| Platform | How it is linked                     | What it covers                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| iOS      | Static library in `arti.xcframework` | Nostr relay WebSockets only                  |
| Android  | `libarti_airhop.so` in `jniLibs`     | Every socket the app opens, `fetch` included |

The coverage column is the one asymmetry, and it is a platform limit rather than
a choice. React Native on Android is OkHttp end to end, so installing the proxy
into `OkHttpClientProvider` at application start covers `fetch` and WebSocket at
once. iOS has no equivalent hook, so nostr-tools is handed a WebSocket that
speaks SOCKS5 and everything else stays outside the tunnel. That is why a Cashu
mint call is refused on iOS while Tor is on, and needs no such refusal on
Android. See [section 7](#7-payments).

Both fail closed at the socket, and for the same reason: Arti has no clearnet
path. A request made before a circuit exists fails rather than falling back, so
protection starts when the user consents rather than when the circuit finishes
forming.

Failing closed is about traffic. Failing safe is a separate promise about the
rest of the app: a bug in the Tor client must cost the user Tor and nothing else.
Two things carry it. Every FFI entry point runs inside a `catch_unwind`, so a
panic in Arti returns an error code rather than terminating a process that is
also running the Bluetooth mesh, the wallet and the courier store. And
`torStartPending` is written across the native start and read back at launch, so
a failure severe enough to end the process is not replayed by the next launch:
Tor comes up off, the Tor screen says why, and the mesh starts normally. Without
it, persisting the preference before the client exists (which is what stops a
relaunch mid-bootstrap from landing on the clear net) would turn one native crash
into an app that cannot be opened, whose only remedy is deleting the user's
keys.

Tor covers internet traffic only. BLE, WiFi Aware and LAN are local radios and
have nothing to route.

Tor hides the device IP from the relay and DM metadata from the relay operator.
On a direct connection it does not conceal that Tor is in use, since the first
hop goes to a publicly listed relay. Settings, Tor, Connection closes that: a
bridge is an unlisted entry point, and the transport in front of it disguises
the connection.

| Connection | What it hides                             | Cost                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Direct     | The IP, from the relay                    | None. The default                      |
| Snowflake  | That Tor is in use, with no list to block | Slowest to connect                     |
| Bridge     | That Tor is in use, over obfs4            | Public lines, some networks block them |
| Custom     | The same, from lines you supply           | You fetch them yourself                |

Bridges stay off by default: one is slower than a direct connection and only
earns that cost on a network that blocks or watches for Tor.

obfs4 and Snowflake are Go, and Arti would normally run them as the child
processes iOS forbids, so they are compiled into the app
([`native/iptproxy`](../../native/iptproxy)) and reached over loopback as
unmanaged transports. Built-in lines are synced from the Tor Project by
`.github/workflows/sync-bridges.yml`, because a list frozen at release time goes
stale between store updates and would fail exactly where a user needed it.

The client refuses to start rather than fall back: a line that does not parse, a
transport Airhop does not ship, or one whose local proxy is not running stops
the start before anything binds. A user who asked for a bridge is likely
somewhere a direct connection is unsafe.

### Building the Tor client

The binaries are committed, and both are built here rather than vendored.
`native/arti/build-in-container.sh` produces the Android libraries inside a
pinned container (Rust, NDK, Debian snapshot and `Cargo.lock` all fixed by
`TOOLCHAIN.env`), and `native/arti/build-apple.sh` produces the xcframework on
macOS. `scripts/verify-vendored.js` records every resulting file by hash and CI
fails a build whose binaries moved without the source that claims to produce
them moving too.

### Panic wipe

Triggered from the Profile screen (`src/features/settings/profile-screen.tsx`).
One tap opens a confirmation sheet; three quick taps skip it and wipe
immediately.

1. Remove every private key from the keychain
2. Clear or delete every MMKV partition, including the encrypted wallet file
3. Empty the cache directory. Not just the files Airhop prefixes: a sent
   document, a sent video, an image small enough to send unmodified and the
   saved QR card all live under other names or in the pickers' own
   subdirectories, and a prefix-only sweep leaves every one of them behind
4. Stop Arti and delete its data directory, on both platforms. It sits outside
   the media cache (Application Support on iOS, the files directory on Android)
   and holds a cached consensus, chosen guard nodes and timestamps, which is
   evidence that this device used Tor and roughly when
5. Take every delivered notification out of the system tray. Each carries a
   sender name and a message preview, and they outlive the process

The keychain step is best-effort like the rest, and the wipe continues past a
failure rather than abandoning the data. It is the one step whose outcome is
reported: `panicWipe` returns `keysDestroyed`, and the Profile screen says so
when the OS refused, because a locked keychain on a booted-but-unlocked device
is exactly the seizure case and "your keys are gone" must never be claimed
falsely.

The app is left in a first-run state and drops to onboarding. The process is not
terminated and the sandbox is not otherwise touched.

## 9. Threat Model

### The attacker

Anyone within radio range can transmit anything. They can forge any plaintext
header field (`senderID`, `ttl`, `flags`, `timestamp`), replay captured packets,
mint unlimited identities, and drop or alter anything passing through them. They
cannot break Ed25519, X25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, or SHA-256 preimage resistance.

### Countermeasures

| Threat                             | Countermeasure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Identity impersonation             | `peerID == SHA-256(noiseStaticPubKey)[0:16]`, enforced on announces and completed Noise sessions, so a peer ID cannot be claimed without its key                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Signing-key substitution           | Two tiers. An announce is self-signed, so TOFU pinning holds the first key seen and never replaces it over the air. A key proven inside a Noise session (payload `0x21`) outranks that and may correct a pin an attacker won the race for. No announce can overwrite a proven key, and only an in-person QR scan may re-pin otherwise                                                                               |
| Nostr key claim in an announce     | The npub a peer names for itself is a forwarding address for that peer, nothing more: first claim stands, no claim folds a thread keyed by that npub or re-addresses mail queued for it.

| Capability downgrade               | Announced bits are a discovery hint and never authorise a change in how we send. Encrypted private media is selected only on an authenticated capability, so nobody in radio range can force an attachment into the clear by announcing the bit off                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Replay                             | Content-derived packet IDs, a deduplicator, and a ±2 minute freshness window on every packet at ingress, so stale packets are neither relayed nor acted on. Solicited sync responses are exempt only when tagged `IS_RSR` and attributable to a request made in the last 30 s. Live voice uses a tighter 30 s window                                                                                                |
| Sync amplification                 | `REQUEST_SYNC` and every packet answering one ride at TTL 0, so a rejoining peer's catch-up cannot re-flood the mesh.

| Group takeover                     | A group keeps the creator it was created with, and a state naming a different creator is refused even at a higher epoch.

| Group eviction by a stranger       | A group ID travels in the clear on every group message so relays can carry it. Without the ordering above, anyone who saw one could craft a self-signed state naming themselves creator with a roster omitting the victim, and the victim's client would destroy its own key and drop the room.

The app-switcher snapshot is covered on both platforms, hung off leaving the app rather than losing focus so a system dialog never raises it; Android needs API 33, leaving 26 to 32 exposed. Screenshots stay possible on purpose, and one taken inside a chat is announced to the other side rather than blocked |

### Out of scope

- **Physical proximity.** BLE mesh reveals that you are near certain peers.
- **A location you chose to send.** A location pin carries real coordinates. It is encrypted inside the recipient's Noise session, so no relay can read it, but the recipient holds it and can do what they like with it, including screenshotting it. Sent only on an explicit tap, to one contact, never automatically, never as a reply in kind, and never forwarded onward by the app.
- **A stable peer ID.** It derives from the long-term Noise key and does not rotate, so the same device is linkable across sessions until the identity is regenerated. Only per-cell geohash identities are ephemeral.
- **Attachment confidentiality in a public room.** A photo posted to `#bluetooth` is signed but not encrypted, exactly like the text beside it. A private attachment is sealed inside the recipient's Noise session (payload `0x20`) whenever they have proven they can read one; the signed cleartext form survives only for peers that have not, and it is the wire form bitchat is retiring. Media stays restricted to `#bluetooth` and mesh DMs, and is never bridged.
- **The fact that Tor is in use, on a direct connection.** The first hop then goes to a publicly listed relay and deep packet inspection sees it. A bridge closes this and is a setting rather than the default, because it costs speed. See [section 8](#8-privacy-and-tor).
- **Traffic timing correlation.** An observer watching several BLE radios could infer communication patterns.
- **Courier mail linkability.** The courier recipient tag is keyed on the recipient's public Noise key, which every announce broadcasts, so anyone in radio range can compute a peer's tags for any day and follow their mail. Inherited from bitchat, which documents the same flaw. Fixing it needs a coordinated v2 tag. See [PROTOCOLS.md section 6](PROTOCOLS.md#6-store-and-forward-courier-constants).
- **Authorship of a broadcast, some of the time.** A packet this phone authored leaves with a TTL drawn from 5 to 7, not the fixed maximum: channel messages, group messages, board posts, public files, and live voice with one draw per burst. That removes the deterministic "this radio wrote it" marker but not the top of the range. Announces and directed traffic keep 7.
- **Who you are talking to on the mesh.** Packet headers carry sender and recipient IDs in the clear, as bitchat's do.
- **A compromised OS.** All guarantees are void.
- **Mint trust.** Cashu requires trusting the mint to honour redemption.

Not every packet is signed. Noise handshake messages are unsigned, matching
bitchat, because the peer may not hold our signing key yet and the handshake
authenticates itself. Messages inside a Noise session or a ratchet carry no
redundant signature, since the session already authenticates them. Signatures are
required where a claimed sender is otherwise unverifiable: announces, public and
private channel messages, attachments, voice frames, board posts and gateway
uplinks.

## 10. Localization

Airhop ships in 35 languages. Every user-facing string lives in one catalog per
language under `src/i18n/locales/`, compiled into the bundle: 1,535 strings and
27 plural keys, byte-identical on every device. Working reference:
[`.github/skills/i18n.md`](../../.github/skills/i18n.md).

### Why this sits in the spec

The app is scoped to blackouts, protests and disasters. The languages spoken
there are Persian, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Tamil, Indonesian,
Filipino, Nepali, Ukrainian and Russian. An English-only UI during a shutdown in
Tehran or Dhaka does not reach the person it was built for.

Three of those read right to left and several are written in scripts with
rendering rules the code has to know about, so this is a correctness concern
rather than a presentation one. A mention that never fires, a name that reorders
the punctuation around it and a row frozen in last week's language are all
silent: nothing looks broken, and the feature simply does not work.

### Decisions

| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bundled catalogs, never fetched                  | A translation download is a network call and a fingerprint, and it would fail in exactly the conditions this app exists for                                                                                                                                                                             |
| No i18n library                                  | i18next and react-intl bring namespaces, lazy network backends and untyped runtime keys, none of which suits an offline-first app with a bundled catalog                                                                                                                                                |
| Completeness enforced by `tsc`                   | Every locale is `Record<TranslationKey, string>` derived from `en.ts`, so a partial locale does not compile and needs no runtime fallback                                                                                                                                                               |
| Plural rules hand-written, not polyfilled        | Hermes has no `Intl.PluralRules`. 35 languages reduce to nine CLDR rule shapes, so `plurals.ts` is nine functions rather than a dependency plus a locale-data module per language. `plurals.test.ts` checks every rule against Node's ICU                                                               |
| Device language read through `Intl`              | `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().locale` is present on Hermes on both platforms. `expo-localization` would mean a config plugin against native trees that must never see `prebuild`                                                                                                             |
| Translation happens at display, never at storage | A `t()` result written into MMKV freezes in the language of the day it was stored. Persisted rows keep a `systemKey` and translate on render                                                                                                                                                            |
| A right-to-left switch waits for the next launch | React Native fixes layout direction at process start and iOS has no sanctioned self-restart, so the preference is stored and applied next launch. Both facts it depends on are read rather than assumed: `I18nManager.isRTL` for the direction in force, `frameLanguage` for the language it belongs to |
| Every substituted value is bidi-isolated         | A placeholder holds text of unknown direction. Unisolated, the bidirectional algorithm resolves the punctuation around it against whichever way that text reads, so an Arabic name in an English sentence drags the comma to the wrong side. One wrap in `interpolate` covers every key                 |
| Word boundaries are Unicode, not ASCII           | A closing `[\s.,!?;:]` is the punctuation of a third of these languages, so "@name。" has to count as a mention or it passes no mute and raises no notification. Comparisons normalise to NFC, since two keyboards spell the same accented character differently                                        |
| One digit system, locale grouping                | Every number the app renders uses Latin digits, prose counts included, and `catalog.test.ts` forbids a catalog its own. Grouping still follows the locale, which is the half that helps: Hindi and Tamil group by lakh                                                                                  |
| Strings the OS renders stay where it reads them  | Passing them through the app would mean a native shim on both platforms for a permission dialog and a notification. `npm run i18n:native` holds them to the shipped set instead                                                                                                                         |
| A generated pseudolocale, debug builds only      | `qps-ploc` accents every string, brackets it and pads it past the longest real translation of the same key, so a layout can be proven against all 35 languages at once without reading any of them                                                                                                      |

### Which language each surface follows

Both platforms offer a per-app language of their own: Android 13's picker, which
`res/xml/locales_config.xml` opts into, and iOS's, which appears once a bundle
carries more than one localization. Airhop ships its own as well, because
neither exists below Android 13 and because changing a system setting is not
something to ask of somebody using this app under duress.

Two settings for one question, so the split is deliberate:

| Surface                                             | Follows              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Everything rendered by React Native                 | The in-app picker    |
| iOS permission dialogs, Android's foreground notice | The OS per-app value |
| Reverse-geocoded place names                        | The OS per-app value |

On the default "system" preference the two agree, because the device language is
re-sampled on every foreground edge. Android needs that: it recreates the
Activity for a language change while keeping the JS context alive.

Picking a language explicitly pins the app and leaves the OS-rendered strings on
the system value. Writing through to `LocaleManager.setApplicationLocales` would
close that gap and is not done: it recreates the Activity underneath a live
mesh, in-flight transfers and possibly live voice, for five notification
strings.

### What never gets translated

Some strings cross the wire or derive an identity, so a translated variant is an
interop bug rather than a cosmetic one. `catalog.test.ts` enforces the full
list, which lives in the skill file. The two that matter here:

- **The username word lists** (`src/utils/username.ts`). A generated name must resolve identically on every device, and in bitchat.
- **The transmitted `/hug` and `/slap` text.** bitchat/ios recognises an incoming emote by matching the English substrings.

Terms of Service and Privacy Policy stay in English, with the reader chrome
around them translated. English is the authoritative version.

Nothing on the wire carries a language, a locale or a script. A Persian reader
and an English one are indistinguishable at the protocol layer, and a courier
holding sealed mail for either cannot tell them apart.

### What varies between devices

Text is identical everywhere because it is compiled in. Three things are not:

| Varies                                        | Handling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Intl` date and number output, per OS and OEM | Centralised in `src/utils/format.ts`, formatted in the app's language rather than the device's, with cached formatters and Latin digits throughout                                                                                                           |
| Font glyph coverage for non-Latin scripts     | JetBrains Mono covers Latin, Greek and Cyrillic and none of the other ten scripts shipped, so the monospace face is reserved for machine data: a value from a formatter or a constant may use it, a value through a catalog key is prose                     |
| Cached reverse-geocoded place names           | The OS geocoder answers in the device's language. Both native APIs accept a locale and `expo-location` exposes neither, and a native shim for a room-header label is not worth it, so `place-names-store.ts` keys its cache on that language and re-resolves |

## 11. Codebase Layout

Anything that compiles to JS lives in `src/`. Anything that touches hardware
lives in `android/` or `ios/`.

| Path               | Holds                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `android/`         | Kotlin BLE module and the foreground service that keeps the mesh alive            |
| `ios/`             | Swift BLE module built on CoreBluetooth                                           |
| `native/arti/`     | The embedded Tor client in Rust, and the pinned build that produces it            |
| `native/iptproxy/` | The obfs4 and Snowflake transports in Go, and the pinned build that produces them |
| `src/app/`         | The root component and the four-tab state machine                                 |
| `src/bridge/`      | TurboModule specs, the only place native and TypeScript meet                      |
| `src/core/`        | The protocol in pure TypeScript: crypto, mesh, nostr, payments, routing           |
| `src/services/`    | Long-lived runtime wiring, chiefly the mesh service that owns the radios          |
| `src/features/`    | Screens and screen-level logic                                                    |
| `src/store/`       | Zustand state with MMKV persistence                                               |
| `src/ui/`          | Shared components, hooks, and theme tokens                                        |
| `src/platform/`    | Thin wrappers over OS APIs: permissions, haptics, battery settings                |
| `src/utils/`       | Stateless helpers, free of side effects                                           |
| `src/i18n/`        | Translation runtime and the bundled English catalog                               |
| `src/__tests__/`   | Whole-app suites: the device harness, lifecycle, and the simulator                |
| `assets/data/`     | Bundled relay list, refreshed by CI                                               |

### Inside the mesh engine

`src/core/mesh/` is the one subsystem large enough to be grouped further, into
`wire/`, `routing/`, `links/`, `sync/`, `discovery/`, `rooms/`, `courier/` and
`voice/`. Two of them carry rules worth stating here:

- `wire/` is the byte layout [section 4](#4-messaging-protocol) and
  [PROTOCOLS.md](PROTOCOLS.md) describe, so a diff that changes the wire format
  shows up under one directory.
- `links/` is the one table of links the device holds, over every transport, and
  the only place bytes are written to one. It answers what is connected and
  writes down a named link; every decision about what to send, and what a
  refused write means, stays in `src/services/mesh-service.ts`.

### Module boundaries

A module specifier that leaves its top-level layer is written as a path alias
(`@core/mesh/wire/packet-codec`); one that stays inside the layer stays
relative. Aliases live in `tsconfig.json` and are mirrored in `package.json`
for jest.

`src/core/` imports nothing native, so the whole protocol is testable in CI
without a phone: the wire format, the handshakes and the routing. The radios
stay unproven until a field test.

The native layer exposes an identical TypeScript interface on both platforms, so
a fix in gossip sync fixes iOS and Android at once and protocol changes ship
together.

### Builds and CI

Gradle builds `android/` into an `.aab` and Xcode builds `ios/` into an `.ipa`,
and the stores treat the result as a fully native app.

Android is automated end to end. `ci.yml` builds a full R8-minified release on
every change, so a broken keep rule or a dependency that stops being 16 KB
aligned fails a pull request rather than a tagged release, and `release.yml`
builds and signs the shipped APK and AAB.

iOS is automated up to signing. `ci.yml` compiles an unsigned Release build on a
macOS runner, so native and release-only breakage fails the same pull request
Android does. Distribution credentials do not exist yet, so the `ios-release` job
in `release.yml` is a placeholder and the shipped `.ipa` is still produced by
hand from Xcode.

Neither platform uses EAS, and likely never will: its main draws are prebuild
and managed credentials, and this project does not run prebuild.

## 12. Native Modules

Hardware requires native code. Routing, crypto, Nostr and payments do not, and
native code is harder to test, keep consistent across platforms and reason about.
So there is one module per hardware capability and no more.

| Module              | Platform | Capability                                               |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AirhopBLEModule`   | Both     | BLE GATT Peripheral and Central, radio state, power mode |
| `AirhopVoiceModule` | Both     | AAC-LC capture and playback for voice notes and PTT      |
| `AirhopWiFiModule`  | Both     | WiFi Aware same-platform fast path                       |
| `AirhopLANModule`   | Both     | mDNS discovery and the TCP links behind it               |
| `AirhopWiFiPairing` | iOS      | The system pairing sheet that fast path needs            |
| `AirhopTorModule`   | Both     | Embedded Arti's lifecycle and bootstrap status           |
| `AirhopTorSocket`   | iOS      | The SOCKS5 WebSocket that iOS needs and Android does not |

None of them knows anything about packets, routing or encryption.

### The native contract

Bridge specs live in `src/bridge/`. They are hand-maintained, not Codegen
input: the native modules are legacy bridge modules reached through the New
Architecture interop layer, and the spec shape keeps both platforms exposing
the same surface. Bytes cross base64-encoded, the only representation both
runtimes agree on safely.

`src/bridge/NativeAirhopBLE.ts` is the largest, at ten methods:

1. `startAdvertising` / `stopAdvertising`: GATT Peripheral
2. `startScanning` / `stopScanning`: GATT Central
3. `writeToLink`: raw bytes to a connected peer
4. `getRadioState`: support, power, authorization, location and battery in one answer
5. `setPowerMode`: how hard to run the radios
6. `requestEnableBluetooth` / `openLocationSettings`: one-tap fixes for the Mesh banner
7. `setBackgroundServiceEnabled`: hold the process up, independent of advertising

Nothing about Tor is asked of it. `AirhopTorModule` owns that and answers
directly; a radio module reporting on Tor would be a boundary violation.

Native calls back with eight events: `packetReceived`, `linkConnected`,
`linkDisconnected`, `rssiUpdated`, `adapterStateChanged`, `powerStateChanged`,
`scanFailed` and `meshStopRequested`.

`AirhopWiFiModule` mirrors the shape with four of its own: `packetReceived`,
`linkConnected`, `linkDisconnected` and `availabilityChanged`. The last is what
lets the fast path recover without a relaunch. Android carries both edges, from
the framework's WiFi Aware state broadcast; iOS has no such broadcast and
reports only the falling edge, so the reconciler answers a drop with its retry
ladder rather than by waiting to be told the radio came back.

`AirhopWiFiPairing` is iOS-only and not part of that contract:
pairing is a precondition to HAVING links on one platform, not a property of a
link, so folding it in would make the Kotlin module answer three questions that
mean nothing there. Two methods (`getPairingState`, `presentPairing`) and one
event (`devicesChanged`), which is also how a pairing removed in the Settings app
reaches the transport.

Anything richer would put protocol knowledge on the native side, which this
design exists to prevent.

### Background execution

| Platform | Mechanism                                           | Result                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| iOS      | `UIBackgroundModes: bluetooth-central`              | Receives BLE data while backgrounded               |
| iOS      | `UIBackgroundModes: bluetooth-peripheral`           | Keeps advertising, though not visibly to Android   |
| iOS      | `CBCentralManagerOptionRestoreIdentifierKey`        | Relaunches the app on a BLE event after suspension |
| Android  | `AirhopForegroundService` (persistent notification) | Survives Doze and battery optimization             |
| Android  | `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE`               | Required for that service on Android 14+           |
| Android  | `neverForLocation` on `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`              | Delivers scan results without a location grant     |

The scan flag is what makes the rest deliver. Android treats a BLE scan as a
location access unless the manifest says otherwise, and an app counts as
foreground for location only with a visible activity or a `location`-typed
foreground service. A `connectedDevice` service does not qualify, so a
backgrounded Airhop held its process up, kept a notification reading
"Discovering and relaying nearby messages", and was handed no scan results.

bitchat solves this with `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` and a `location` service
type. Airhop asserts `neverForLocation` instead, which is accurate here: a scan
result is read for its service UUID, its 8-byte peer ID and its RSSI, none of
which is a position. From API 31 that removes the coupling entirely. API 26 to 30
keeps it, since the flag does not exist there; `getRadioState` reports which
regime applies through `locationRequiredForScan`, read only by `blockerFor`.

Location is still requested, but only for geohash channels, and only when the
user opens one.

A backgrounded iPhone is not discoverable from Android. Once the app leaves the
foreground, CoreBluetooth moves the service UUID into the advertisement's
overflow area and drops the local name, where only another iOS device scanning
for that exact UUID can see it. iPhone-to-iPhone still works, iPhone-to-Android
discovery stops until the app is reopened, and an already connected link keeps
carrying traffic. Android has no equivalent restriction, since the foreground
service keeps it advertising normally.

## 13. Decision Log

### Nostr over Matrix, XMPP or Signal

| Protocol        | Verdict      | Reason                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Matrix          | Rejected     | Requires a homeserver, which is a single point of failure. Federated but not serverless                                                           |
| XMPP            | Rejected     | Also requires an always-on server, with a complex extension ecosystem and a limited offline story                                                 |
| Signal Protocol | Rejected     | Signal owns the relay infrastructure and requires a phone number, so it is not permissionless                                                     |
| SimpleX         | Close second | No persistent identifiers and privacy-first, but no BLE mesh story, a smaller ecosystem and fewer relays                                          |
| Nostr           | Chosen       | Permissionless keypair identity, 300+ independent relays, NIP-17 gift-wrap for DMs, NIP-61 for payments, and bitchat already validated the choice |

### Noise XX over TLS or X3DH

- TLS requires CAs and server certificates, which a serverless system cannot have
- X3DH alone does not mutually authenticate: the receiver does not authenticate the sender in the handshake
- Noise XX gives mutual authentication and forward secrecy with no CAs, is proven in WireGuard, and is what bitchat uses

### Relay URLs stay strict

`validateRelayUrl` refuses `ws://`, bare IP addresses, `.local`, `localhost`,
`.internal` and single-label hosts. That is deliberate and stays.

Relaxing it would compromise two things at once. Android blocks cleartext from
API 28 and its network security config cannot scope an exception to an address
range, so permitting `ws://` to a user-typed address means permitting cleartext
for the whole app, including the mint URLs that carry bearer ecash. And a
`ws://` public host would put gift-wrapped DMs on the open internet unencrypted,
which is worse than anything the change would buy.

A relay reachable only on a local network is served by the LAN transport in
[section 3](#lan-transport), which needs no cleartext exception because it does
not go through the HTTP stack at all.

### Cashu over Lightning alone

- Lightning needs internet at the moment of payment, since routing happens live
- Cashu tokens are strings that flow over BLE like any message
- Transfer is fully offline and redemption happens later
- NIP-61 integrates Cashu with Nostr identity for online payments

### Double Ratchet alongside Noise XX

- Noise XX gives forward secrecy per session, with a new key on each reconnect
- It does not give per-message forward secrecy within a session
- Double Ratchet rotates keys per message, so one message's key does not expose its neighbours
- It also covers offline mail: a ratcheted message sent by courier keeps forward secrecy while the recipient is away

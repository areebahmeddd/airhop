// AirhopWiFiModule: WiFi Aware high-bandwidth transport for Airhop.
//
// Uses Android's WiFi Aware (NAN) API to create peer-to-peer data channels
// without a router or internet connection. Range: ~30 m, ~250 Mbps.
//
// Architecture contract: no protocol or routing logic here. This module
// exposes raw bytes to TypeScript exactly as AirhopBLEModule does.
//
// Three operations:
//   1. Publish: advertise this device as an Airhop WiFi Aware peer.
//   2. Subscribe: discover peers advertising the same service.
//   3. Connect: open a socket once WifiAwareNetworkSpecifier is available.
//
// Events emitted to TypeScript (same names as BLE module for symmetry):
//   AirhopWiFi.packetReceived   { linkID, dataBase64 }
//   AirhopWiFi.linkConnected    { linkID }
//   AirhopWiFi.linkDisconnected { linkID }
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Establishing a data path
//
// An Aware data path is not Wi-Fi Direct: there is no group owner and no
// 192.168.49.x subnet, only a private link-local IPv6 interface. The peer
// address is not derivable from the PeerHandle. It arrives once, in
// NetworkCallback.onCapabilitiesChanged as WifiAwareNetworkInfo, so a callback
// implementing only onAvailable never sees it.
//
// The roles are asymmetric although both devices run both halves:
//
//   Responder (publisher): opens a ServerSocket on an ephemeral port and passes
//   it to the specifier via setPort(), then waits. setPort is server-side only;
//   on the initiator it builds a specifier the framework cannot match.
//
//   Initiator (subscriber): no port on the specifier, and connects to
//   getPeerIpv6Addr()/getPort() through that Network's own SocketFactory. The
//   default factory would route over the default network, not the Aware one.
//
// Both sides publish and subscribe, so without a tiebreak each pair opens two
// sockets. Each device carries a random per-attach token in the publish config
// serviceSpecificInfo and dials only when its own token sorts lower. Same shape
// as the crossed Noise handshake tiebreak on the BLE side.

// Airhop WiFi Aware service name. Not a UUID, and not free-form either.
//
// NAN derives the on-air service ID by hashing this exact string, so a
// difference of one character means two devices never match. It therefore has to
// be identical here, in AirhopWiFiModule.swift, and in the `WiFiAwareServices`
// key of ios/Airhop/Info.plist.
//
// The DNS-SD wrapper is Apple's requirement rather than Android's: iOS accepts
// only `_name._tcp` or `_name._udp`, with a name component of at most 15
// characters from [A-Za-z0-9-]. Android accepts any ASCII string under 255
// bytes, so it is the side that moves. "airhop-mesh-v1" is 14 characters and
// legal, which is why the name itself did not have to change.
//
// This was "airhop-mesh-v1", so an Android build from before this change and one
// from after it do not form an Aware link. That is deliberate and it is cheap:
// they still meet over BLE, which is where every compatibility promise actually
// lives, and doing the rename now rather than when iOS to Android becomes
// possible avoids a flag day later. bitchat is unaffected either way, since it

// React Native module exposing Airhop's embedded Tor client to TypeScript.
//
// Mirrors ios/Airhop/AirhopTorModule.swift method for method and event for
// event, so src/services/tor-routing.ts needs no platform branch.
//
// Protocol logic lives in TypeScript. This file knows about a proxy port and a
// bootstrap percentage, and nothing about packets, relays or encryption.

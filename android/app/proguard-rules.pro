# The JNI bridge to the embedded Tor client.
#
# A native method is resolved by name at call time: the runtime looks for the
# symbol `Java_org_onemindlabs_airhop_tor_ArtiNative_nativeStart` and so on. R8
# does not know that, so left to itself it renames the class and the methods,
# every lookup misses, and the first attempt to switch Tor on throws
# UnsatisfiedLinkError.
#
# Debug builds are not minified, so this fails only in release, and only for the
# one feature. Named explicitly rather than through the usual blanket
# `-keepclasseswithmembernames class * { native <methods>; }`, because this is
# the only JNI in the app and a rule that says which class and why is worth more
# than one that quietly covers whatever appears later.

# The gomobile bindings for the pluggable transports.
#
# Go calls back into these generated classes by name, the same way the Arti JNI
# above is resolved, so R8 renaming them would break the transports only in
# release and only once a user turns bridges on.

# Drop debug logging from release builds.
#
# Nearly all d/v logs come from bundled libraries (React Native, Expo, Fresco),
# and they would otherwise fill the shared buffer on release devices. Minification
# alone keeps Log calls; this needs the optimizing ProGuard config. The calls go,
# though string building around them may remain.
